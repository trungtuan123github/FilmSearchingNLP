His wife being such a plain dresser causes John to dislike taking her out, and he consequently pays a lot of attention to Mrs. Airlie, who is vivacious and stylish. This arouses Betty's jealousy, and she decides to buy some stylish and expensive clothes just as the stock market goes wrong with John. An old friend of Betty's arrives and brings her news of a vast fortune left her and that she is now Lady Betty Manners. Betty keeps the news a secret and proceeds to spend the money on gowns, hats, automobiles, etc. John soon finds that the only thing left of his wealth is their estate in the west, and he goes there to sell it. When Betty hears of this she organizes a party, secures a private car, and leaves for California. Betty and her party arrive there first. As John and Mrs. Airlie stroll through the park they are confronted by Betty and Sir Harry, who seem to be quite fond of each other. Unknown to John, Sir Harry buys the estate for Betty. John, by this time insanely jealous, calls upon Sir Harry at his hotel, where a struggle ensues. John fires, and believes he has killed Sir Harry. Terrorized, he returns home in a pouring rainstorm and Betty hides him on an open porch. The police enter, as does Sir Harry, and John is brought to the realization of how foolish he has been. He is forgiven all around and all is well.",

    "description": "A group of wealthy men try to corner the cotton market and force up the price. They succeed in their plans, and the market is thrown into a panic. To be entirely successful, it is necessary for them to take into their group John Osborne, who controls a great deal of cotton. They approach him with their plan, but he refuses to agree. Therefore, when cotton is high, he sells, thereby reducing the price, and incidentally making a large amount of money for himself. Osborne returns to the town of his birth, and buys the Ashton Cotton Mills from Henry Stockley and his son, Richard. He retains Richard as his general manager. On the day he takes over the mills the furnace blows up, due to the negligence of Shillinglaw, the drunken engineer. During the explosion a man is killed, and Osborne gives his clerk, Piper, money to be given to the widow. This money, however, Piper keeps, and the fact is known only to Richard Stockley, who observed him putting it away. In the mills there is working a young girl, named Elsie Kent, who is the sole support of her grandmother. She falls in love with Richard, and he betrays her. Osborne falls in love with Hetty Drayson. who lives with her mother. The Draysons had been wealthy, Mr. Drayson having been Henry Stockley's partner in the Ashton Mills, but because he had married the girl whom Stockley loved, Stockley. in revenge, ruined him. Drayson had shortly afterward died, and Mrs. Drayson had since been very bitter against Stockley. One day Henry Stockley is thrown from his horse and brought home in a dying condition. Before he dies, he makes his will. He feels remorse at the way he treated the Draysons, and he determines to make retribution. He leaves his property to his son, Richard, on the condition of Richard's marrying Hetty Drayson, thereby making up to the daughter for the wrong he did to the parents. This puts Richard in a quandary. He wants the money, and yet he knows that Hetty loves Osborne. Besides, there is Elsie, who is soon to become a mother. He solves the problem by spreading the report that Osborne is the betrayer of Elsie, thus alienating Hetty's affection from Osborne. Osborne's life is threatened. Osborne, foreseeing that there will be a great falling off in the price of cotton, telegraphs his broker in code to \"sell out.\" The code number representing this is twenty-four. He gives this telegram to Piper to send. Richard waylays Piper, and, threatening to expose the latter's record of theft, makes him change the 24 to 124, which means \"hold.\" Thus the bottom falls out of the cotton market, and Osborne is ruined. Osborne sells a half interest in the mills, and realizes enough to meet his liabilities. By this time the mill workers come to Osborne's office to attack him for the supposed betrayal of Elsie. Elsie, however, comes in, and to save Osborne, tells them the truth about Richard. The men turn and wish to lynch Richard, but Osborne saves him. Soon after this Elsie dies. Richard follows Osborne to New York and determines to get him out of the way, for now, with Elsie dead, he is in a position to marry Hetty. When he arrives in New York he sends a bogus telegram to Osborne as if from his broker, telling Osborne that he is sending an automobile to take Osborne to his country place over Sunday. When the automobile is out in the country, Osborne is seized and thrown in a deserted house. However, Osborne manages to overpower his captor and escapes. Meanwhile, Richard has gone home and telegraphs to Hetty, saying that Osborne is dead. He goes to see her, and pleads for her hand. She repulses him. He, in anger, pushes her into an elevator, and makes it descend. Before the elevator reaches the bottom, Osborne arrives and saves Hetty. Richard then is unmasked and is led away to prison.",

Meanwhile, the owner's son Leo confesses his love for Jan's daughter Annie, but Van Haaften forbids their marriage.

    "description": "An ugly moment in a Berlin bar knocks Yasmina from her usual path and launches us into a series of encounters in a precarious world, beyond the neon and the billboards. Inspired by Schnitzler's scandalous 19th century play, Reigen, ATOMEN is a story set in contemporary Berlin, exploring the longing for love and connection, and the alienation of modern life. Using the structure of Schnitzler's play, we explore the inadequacy of language, the devastation of our societies, and the epic in the everyday. Our characters stumble through life, looking for meaning, in a world where we are told everything is available, but people are often lost and lonely. Their dilemmas are small, but reflect the ripples of seismic decisions made in a boardroom somewhere by someone.",

    "description": "Frank Austin, a soldier, one day sees Colonel Kinkaid, his superior officer, abusing a little lame newsboy, and in a passion knocks the coward down. He is court-martialed for this and given a sentence of five years. That night the newsboy aids him to escape from the guardhouse, and Austin sets out for Colorado. Thomas Doyle is a professor of languages in a college and lives happily with his wife, Mary, and Kitty, his sister. His wife's health has been failing for some time, and at last the doctor tells them the only hope for her is that she seek a drier climate. On the way Doyle, his wife and Kitty make the acquaintance of Colonel Kinkaid, who is going to Denver on business, and makes himself useful to the party. Kinkaid wires a henchman of his, Staples, a gambler and crook. By acting as Kinkaid's agent, Staples gets Doyle to invest in worthless land, leaving Doyle with a balance of only five hundred dollars. Austin has been working a claim just above the tract bought by Doyle, and one day while he is working he is accosted by one of the natives, Old Morgan, tells him that he will never find anything there, whereupon Austin shows him some samples taken out of the claim which prove to be rich in gold. With the dry season Doyle finds everything on his land is dead and Old Morgan tells him that his land would be rich if it was irrigated, but that it is worthless as it is. Doyle is discouraged over his finances, but finds consolation in the fact that his wife is very much improved. Staples had noticed Austin working, and stealing some of the ore, takes it to Kinkaid and the two have it assayed. It proves to be very rich and they plan to work the young man out of his claim. Kitty and her brother are out hunting one day and discover Austin wounded by a blast. They pick him up and take him to Doyle's house. They find that Kinkaid has arrived at Doyle's, and made himself very much at home. Kitty is sent for water, and after she has been gone a long time, her brother goes in search of her. He finds her in the grasp of Staples. They fight and Staples confesses that Kinkaid was back of the land deal. Kinkaid recognizes Austin and makes the ex-soldier give him a partnership in his mine. The mine is developed, and Doyle accepts a position as foreman. Kinkaid has given Mrs. Doyle a revolver, and one day takes her for a hunt. Staples accosts Doyle at the mine. Doyle thrashes him and Staples swears revenge. Later, when Doyle and Kitty have gone down in the mine, Staples manages to stop the lift and prevent their escape during a blast. The blast goes off and a flood of water is released in the mine. They are rescued just in time by Austin. The water proves the key to wealth for Doyle as it irrigates his arid land. Staples is drowned. Doyle tells Kinkaid of the flooding of the mine and finds him in intimate conversation with his wife. He throws him out and demands an explanation from his wife. Mrs. Doyle, unable to explain, leaves home and goes to Denver. Austin goes to work for Doyle, his mine being flooded. He and Kitty are in love with each other, but every time he goes to take her in his arms he thinks of the sentence hanging over him and stops. Both Kitty and her brother suspect that something is wrong and finally get him to explain the cause. In the city, Kinkaid seeks every opportunity to put himself in Mary's way and finally one day she draws a gun on him and forces him out of the room. Kitty, her brother, and Austin arrive at the hotel, and while the men are seeking Kinkaid, Kitty finds her sister-in-law. The women return in time to see a fight between Doyle and Kinkaid, and Mary saves her husband's life by shooting Kinkaid in the arm. Kinkaid is forced to write a letter clearing Austin and all return to the tract. Doyle and his wife are reconciled. Some time later Austin gets his pardon and there is now nothing to hinder his marriage with Kitty.",

    "description": "Barnard completes a study in oils which he calls \"The Resurrection.\" It represents a beautiful, dark woman, her awakened soul shining from her eyes. At a private exhibit in the studio the painting causes a great deal of admiring comment, and Barnard's mother, a society leader and an art connoisseur, admits to her son that he virtually \"imprisoned a woman's soul\" in the canvas. The soul of the picture, a few days later, stirs to the depths of her being a sordid girl of the underworld whom Barnard has found in the night courts and persuaded to become his model for \"The Fallen Woman.\" Irene Brock, once she has met the rapt, spiritual gaze of Barnard's ideal, involuntarily revolts against the hideousness of her environment. The trade she has been accustomed to ply in saloon dance-halls and low resorts becomes a torture to her. Day by day Irene watches the new painting grow. But she is changing. Barnard, feeling that something is unsatisfactory, and that he will be unable to paint from his model \"The Fallen Woman\" of his imagination, reluctantly brings the sittings to a close. The moment of parting precipitates an emotional crisis. Love, for the first time, has dawned in the girl's soul, and Barnard, moved by a profound sympathy, takes her in his arms. The young artist's mother finds them in this position; she diplomatically conceals her horror while smilingly asserting that \"that could never be.\" Irene goes away, struggling to be resigned. But the young artist, fired by a self-sacrificing love, refuses to let this end the episode. At last, the mother seeks Irene in her squalid lodging. \"Such a marriage,\" she pleads with the girl, \"would make my son a social outcast. Even your love could not always make him forget.\" The soul of \"The Resurrection\" working upon her heart, and controlled also by her deep love for Barnard, Irene promises to cure him of his passion. That same night she deliberately gives herself up to a detective an old enemy of hers. The following morning she sends for Barnard to come to the night court and pay her fine. He goes. She is brought before the judge. To the charge, she replies, \"I am guilty.\" Silently, Barnard puts the money on the desk. Outside, in the corridor, they meet. By sheer force of will, she resists the almost overwhelming impulse to fling herself in his arms and tell him the entire story of her deception. The next instant, with a murmured good-bye, he turns and rushes out of doors. That evening Irene slips into the deserted studio, and stands long before the painting of \"The Resurrection.\" From these wonderful eyes she imbibes strength for her lonely struggle with the world.",

Restoratives are quickly applied and Annette comes back to life. Then follows an agony of suspense for Herbert. Will she live and spoil his present happiness, or will she die?

After the girls leave him at Belmore Castle, reputed to be haunted, the Hindu caretaker Sakes relates the following tale: Henry Claven, Sakes' master, courted his beautiful neighbor Betty Truesdale, but when she became engaged to Captain Bob Lambert, Claven precipitated a duel by telling Lambert that he knew his mother was a negress. The duel, by Claven's request, required each man to bare his arm to a deadly snake. Because Claven secretly smeared a repellent oil on his arm, the snake struck Lambert. After Betty convinced Sakes to let the snake bite her also, the couple, as ghosts, took their honeymoon in a phantom automobile to India and Egypt, and returned to haunt the castle as happy lovers. Sakes shows the scoffing professor the room where the lovers died. He sees them leave their auto and chase the ghost of the recently deceased Claven. Afterwards, Tidewater and his daughters are convinced that Sakes mesmerized him.",

    "description": "Two women unknown to each other, in the early history of the nation, decide to make of their babies \"hidden children,\" in accordance with the Indian custom of giving children to foster-parents until maturity. A girl and a boy thus \"hidden,\" when informed of the truth, returned to their people and were expected by marrying to bring a fresh spirit into the tribe. Marie Loskiel, hard beset by the St. Regis Indians, gives her child, Euan, before she dies, to Guy Johnson, an English Colonial officer. He and Mayaro, a Sagamore of the Mohicans, who is Johnson's chief scout, take charge of the child. Jeanne de Contrecoeur, wife of the commandant of the French garrison at Lake George, amuses the officers and their wives by her gift of clairvoyance. She implores her husband not to go out to battle with the Indians, as she has a premonition that he will be killed, and that the child to be born will never know a father. But duty calls Capt. de Contrecoeur, and he is slain by the Iroquois. Jeanne herself is captured by them, and taken to the stronghold of the Six Nations at Catherinestown. The Erie sorcerer Amochol is about to sacrifice Jeanne's new-born daughter, Lois, to the Moon Witch, but she makes of Lois a \"hidden child,\" sending her to a colonist named Calvert. Jeanne is about to be killed by Amochol when she correctly interprets a dream for him, and she becomes the White Sorceress of the Iroquois. Each year Jeanne sends secretly to little Lois a pair of moccasins, embroidered with a symbol indicating that she is a hidden child. Calvert cannot read the inscription, but when he dies he tells Lois of her origin, and it becomes the girl's one thought to find the trail to Catherinestown where her mother is held captive. Euan Loskiel, grown to manhood, is given a commission in Morgan's rifles as Lieutenant and Chief of Indian Scouts. General Sullivan wishes to crush the tribes of the Six Nations in the \"Long House\" of the Iroquois Confederacy, and the only man who can lead him to Catherinestown is Mayaro the Sagamore, whom Euan brings to the General, and the Sagamore becomes the trusted messenger of the northern Colonial army. Lois disguises herself as a camp-follower in rags to follow Euan, Mayaro and Lieut. Boyd to Catherinestown. Mayaro saves her from the insults of a drunken officer, and though she has thus far distrusted all men, she has complete faith in the Sagamore. He reads the message of the moccasins, discovering that she is a hidden child, and protects her from all the mischances of the journey. Euan Loskiel falls in love with this strange girl in rags, but it is with difficulty that he wins her confidence, since, wandering alone since Calvert's death, she has seen nothing but the baser side of men's natures. Finally, however, her fears are stilled by Euan's nobility of character, and she, Euan and Mayaro, become close friends, the red man and Euan going through the sacred ceremonial of the blood brotherhood. Lois at last confesses her love for Euan, but will not permit his caresses until she has found her mother. She undertakes the perilous journey into the heart of the Iroquois empire, following the army secretly, since they will not consent to her accompanying them on such a dangerous mission. Mayaro, who shares the secret, blazes the trail so that she may find the way. When she overtakes them, the Indians insist that the ceremony of the White Bridal be performed over these two sacred \"hidden children,\" Lois and Euan. They reach Catherinestown in time to witness the Feast of the Dreams. Amochol is about to put the White Sorceress of the Iroquois (Jeanne de Contrecoeur) to death for interpreting ill fortune. Her prediction comes true when the warriors of the Six Nations defeated by Sullivan's men return. The executioner is about to strike her when his arm is transfixed by a shaft from Mayaro's bow. The priests take Jeanne prisoner, but Euan and Mayaro, following them to the Vale Yndaia, kill them and rescue her, and Mayaro slays Amochol in hand-to-hand combat. Lois is at last folded in the arms of the mother who has watched and waited for her all these years, and then Jeanne de Contrecoeur, having been reunited with her \"hidden child,\" puts her hand in that of the gallant scout, Euan Loskiel, and their White Bridal is completed.",

    "description": "Bradford Stewart, a young American surgeon studying in Germany, is dining in Cologne with a German friend, Ritter Bloem, a philosopher and a patriotic German. The latter is called away by German officers, and on his return announces to Stewart that war has been declared. After Bloem's departure, Trapadoux, chief of the French Secret Service maintained in Germany, who has been listening to their conversation, accosts Stewart, claiming to be one of the German police agents, inspects his passport, and learns to which hotel he will go in Aachen, which is his next destination. Frau Schanne, the proprietress of the Holmer Hof, secretly maintains French sympathies, but her servant, Hans, is a German spy. In Stewart's absence from his room, Trapadoux brings Frau Schanne a package, the contents of which he instructs her to place in Stewart's baggage to avert police suspicion during their later moves. Upon his return to his room Stewart finds in his luggage a lady's slippers, silk hose and dainty lingerie. The door of his room is opened and Little Comrade hurries in, embraces him fondly and calling him husband. Outside the door Hans listens, perplexed and a little suspicious, but had he not seen the lady's garments in Stewart's belongings? Perhaps, after all, she is his wife. After making sure of Hans' retirement, Little Comrade explains to Stewart that she is a French spy fleeing from Germany with secrets stolen from the German officers with whom she has been wont to flirt in Alsace-Lorraine; that even now they are on the watch for her and that if she is brought back, death will be the penalty. Stewart consents to help her, and watches while she forges an addition to his passport, adding to his own name and description, the description of herself as his wife traveling with him. Together they pass the gauntlet of police inspection and board the train for Brussels. At the frontier the train is held up and all passengers inspected. The police inspector stationed there holds Stewart and his \"wife\" for the coming of a German' officer from Metz to identify Little Comrade. One of the French spies on the frontier summons Trapadoux, who comes in the guise of the officer from Metz, and after inspecting Little Comrade, states that she is not the woman spy they feared. In the morning they arrive at the Belgium camp, where they are welcomed, but a few hours later the Belgians muster in battle against the German invaders. Little Comrade and Stewart are wounded, and while Stewart goes for a stretcher for her, she is captured by a genuine officer from Metz, who takes her to German headquarters and denounces her as a spy. Bloem, who is in command is unable to persuade her to confess. When Stewart discovers Little Comrade gone, weak from loss of blood, he becomes unconscious for several days. Upon regaining consciousness he learns that Little Comrade has been captured, so he concentrates his energies on delivering to General Joffre the papers she confided to his keeping. In gratitude, General Joffre bestows on Stewart the ribbon of the Legion of Honor, but overwhelmed by his loss and weak from this last effort, Stewart is borne away delirious. At the German headquarters, Bloem finding Little Comrade obdurate, is about to pass sentence upon her when she begs him to send her last words of love to Stewart. Finding that Stewart is her lover, Bloem, whose life was once saved by Stewart, refuses to condemn her, claiming that there is not sufficient evidence, and sends her back to \"her American husband.\" There follows a joyous reunion in the hospital between Stewart and Little Comrade.",

    "description": "During a reception given by Mr. and Mrs. Carey, the topic of \"black sheep\" in families comes up, and Mr. Carey makes the remark that if ever he discovered that there was a thief in the family of the woman he married he would divorce her. The next evening Carey is called away, and Mrs. Carey and her little child are left alone. Mrs. Carey puts her child to bed and goes to her sitting room to read. She thinks of her husband said the day before and a vision of past days comes to her....She is a young woman in good circumstances; her father is a prosperous businessman. One day, though, he returns home to inform his daughter and son that his fortune has been swept away. The loss of his fortune and his position cause him much worry, and he dies from the effects. The brother, accustomed to all the good things of life, finds it hard to do anything. He sells his belongings and gets what money he can. Lower and lower he falls, until one day he is caught by the police in the act of leaving a house by a window and is sent to prison as a burglar. The sister, not wishing to live alone, writes to one of her friends, telling her that she is in poor circumstances, and asks if she might visit her. At once the invitation is extended, and we find her at the handsome home of her friend. Here, as time goes, she meets a wealthy man who learns her story, excepting that part relating to her brother, and he proposes marriage. As the reverie breaks a burglar is seen entering the home of Carey. He glides in quietly, searching for some important papers. He knocks over a stool, which awakens the little child. She at once leaves her bed and goes into the drawing room. The burglar, masked, not knowing who is entering, points his revolver toward the door. The child enters, and the burglar tries to persuade her to go back to her room. Mrs. Carey, hearing the noise, comes hastily to the drawing room. Stealthily she had secured her own revolver, and, seeing the situation, gets the \"drop\" on the masked man and calls to him to throw up his hands. He obeys, but, seeing the woman, pulls off his mask and shows he is her brother. She begs him to leave at once, telling him what her husband had said. While they are talking, the child, seeing the revolver which her mother had laid on the table, picks it up and begins to examine it. She puts the muzzle into her mouth and is fingering with the trigger. The mother and the man see this at the same moment, and the mother starts quickly for the child in an effort to grab the gun. The man, quicker witted, stops her and talks quietly with the child until he gets the gun. At this moment Carey is heard coming in. Mrs. Carey pleads with her brother to leave quickly and she hastens out of the room with the child. Carey enters, sees the lights turned on, turns, and sees the fleeing form of the man. He reaches for his revolver and shoots through the window. The shot attracts a policeman who comes to the scene as Carey reaches the garden and both find the wounded man. He is brought into the house and Mrs. Carey is about to tell who he is, but the brother signals to her and the story is left untold. Mrs. Carey finds herself in straits to explain the situation, but manages it successfully. The gang in its den reading the papers of the next morning and seeing that their confederate had failed in his attempt determine to get the papers themselves. They get into the house, capture Carey, bind him, and get the papers from his open safe. After a while the brother arrives from a short sentence, and is told of their success in getting the papers. He knows now that the papers belong to his brother-in-law, and is anxious to get them. He watches where they are kept and, after drinking and carousing in the den he manages to get the papers, and quietly returns them to Carey's desk one night. The next morning the gang learn that the papers have disappeared and plan revenge. They arrange to kidnap the child and thus cause Carey to give them ransom. The brother hears these plans and joins in them. A few days later the little child is seized by one of the gang. The brother sees the scheme. Just as the child is being thrown into a waiting buggy, he draws his gun, shoots, and wounds the kidnapper. The horse, frightened, leaps away with the child in the vehicle. The young fellow runs behind in an effort to race the horse down. Coming to a motorcycle, he grabs it, and starts a race. Passing the running horse, he dismounts and heads off the runaway. He is slightly hurt, but manages to stop the runaway and starts back with the child. The reconciliation comes when Mrs. Carey tells who the young fellow is, taking the chance which she had always feared. Carey decides to send the young man to one of his plants in South America, extracting first, however, a promise that he will never return to this country and that no hint will ever be given of his past life. The picture ends with the little girl waving goodbye to her young uncle as he leaves on his long voyage.",

    "description": "Dr. John Wright is a young, rising physician. His wife, who was raised in luxury, rebels at their present poverty. Having received an invitation to a great social event, she pleads with her husband to devise some means for obtaining finery, so as to be able to accept the invitation. He borrows two sets of jewels, one of which she loses at the ball. Both are panic stricken. He gives his note for $5,000 to cover the loss. Later he makes a great surgical discovery and becomes famous. Four crooked promoters seek his endorsement to lend legitimacy to their fake tuberculosis cure and promise him $50,000. He refuses. Later the conspirators secure the promissory note and threaten foreclosure. This, and his wife's entreaties to accept the money, influence him to do so. The promoters build a sanatorium and use their dangerous \"Alligator Serum.\" Dr. Wright's little daughter contracts tuberculosis while her father is away at the sanatorium looking over the records. The number of deaths here astound him. Realizing the \"Cure\" to be a fake, he demands the elimination of his name. They refuse and a struggle ensues. The doctor is wounded and they, fearing exposure, imprison him in the sanatorium. Meanwhile the chief promoter makes advances to the shallow wife and claims the doctor has deserted her, but she repulses him and rushes into another room into the arms of her husband, who has escaped. After hearing her story, the doctor throttles the promoter and ejects him from their home. He then finds his child has been given the fatal serum. Dr. Wright hears that a warrant is out for his arrest, on account of his connection with the sanatorium. Grieving over his threatened arrest, the possible death of his only child and his future ruin, he seizes his revolver, contemplating suicide. The three promoters rush in to buy his silence, but all are filled with fear as the police approach. The doctor, followed by the fear-crazed promoters, rushes out and jumps into a launch. They are pursued by another boat containing the police, who open fire. One of the police bullets strikes the gasoline on board the doctor's boat, which explodes, blowing boat and occupants high in the air. Dr. Wright, the survivor, is only slightly injured, and being caught, he is sentenced to \"Thirty Years at Hard Labor,\" for manslaughter. Broken and dejected from the fate which has followed her foolish vanity and her insistence upon her husband accepting the $50,000, and remorse over her fast-failing child, the doctor's wife sits and watches her baby die of tuberculosis. She earns her living by sewing, and meets him after some years of privation at the prison gate, when he has been pardoned after contracting the dread disease. She accompanies him to the famous Adirondack Sanatorium, where he is cured within one year amidst characteristic scenes in and about the sanatorium. The two, now thoroughly restored to health and sanity through their terrible experiences, find much to live for in their mutual, understanding love, though without riches.",

Rich Mrs. Hanway, eager to have her daughter Althea become a princess, takes her with Boris to Rugaria. Meanwhile, Rupert Danza, a Columbia University student, is told by a mysterious envoy that he is needed in Rugaria to lead a revolution. Although he laughs at first, he follows, when he learns that his sweetheart Althea has gone there. While Rupert's knowledge of democracy inspires the revolutionaries, his sword play enables him to rescue Althea from Boris. After an anarchist wounds the king, Rupert is arrested, but as a firing squad prepares to execute him, Countess Olga reveals that he is really the king's son who was kidnapped as a child and sent to America to absorb democracy for the coming revolution. After Rudolph dies, Rupert declines the crown, but is elected president of the newly-created republic. Althea then becomes his First Lady.",

Lulu and Tom finally decide to tell their folks that they have become engaged. They expect a little opposition, for their respective fathers and uncle are enemies, but bravely hope to overcome it and make things right. Lulu leaves Tom at her door and goes in and gladly announces that she is to marry the duke's nephew. A scene ensues and in the duke's castle a like scene is going on. The bishop insists that Lulu marry his curate, whom she despises, while the duke insists that Tom marry his cousin, Lady Mary, who has more brains than beauty. Tom refuses to marry his cousin and is ordered to leave the house. He and Lulu plan to elope. So they leave England to seek their fortune in America, confidently hoping to marry as soon as this is accomplished. Arrived in New York, Tom finds that the only thing he can get to do is peddling books. Meanwhile Lulu attracts the attention of an old chap into whose office she goes, and he at once engages her to be his typewriter. Tom puts up $70 for his books and starts out to sell them. But it seems that \"The Lives of the Saints\" are not popular that year, and so he meets with nothing but failure. He happens into the office where Lulu is at work and there finds her struggling in the embrace of the old man. He fights with the old man and this interference causes Lulu to be \"fired.\" They are unable to pay their hotel bill, and stealing away they seek refuge in the park. In the morning they see an advertisement for a maid and butler, so, pretending they are married, they apply for the jobs and luckily get them. To their consternation they find that the man of the house is the same old fellow in whose office Lulu worked for a few hours. Tom, in his utter surprise, drops a whole tureen full of soup over his master. Lulu warns the old man that if he fires Tom she will tell his wife all. So he agrees to keep his mouth shut. That night Tom and Lulu are shown to the same room. This will not do, so Tom takes his belongings and camps out in the hall. Feeling a bit cold, he steals into what he supposes to be an empty room, only to find it occupied by the cook. She chases him downstairs, where he has a bout with a burglar, who disappears leaving Tom with the bag of loot in his hands. The master and mistress come down. Tom and Lulu are taken for thieves and sent to the police station. Next morning, however, the old man is afraid to prosecute, so they are set free. This time in their search for work they are less fortunate. The only thing they can get is a very menial job called help's help in a large hotel. Here they wait upon the cooks and waiters and are treated with much disdain by their fellow servants. Tom is soon fired, but Lulu keeps the job. In the park Tom is accused of stealing a purse from a fiery old man to whom he was about to restore his property. The old man jails Tom. An old friend of Tom's comes to the hotel and visits the fiery old chap who jailed him. Lulu, who has been forced to don the attire of a bellboy to escape the attentions of a French cook, happens to be sent to their room with some drinks and hears them discussing Tom. Then she hears Tom's friend say that the Duke of Bilgewater is dead, and that his son has been killed in the trenches. She steps forward and discloses her identity. The old man, who proves to be a lawyer who is searching for Tom, asks where his lordship is. Lulu tells the old man that Tom is in jail where he put him. Tom is released and told of his good fortune. He and Lulu lose no time in getting home to England. There they are married at once and go to the castle.",

There is nothing of the bully or braggart about him. He is just a man who knows instinctively what is right and never falters in his steps to see that justice is given where it is deserved and crime punished on the same basis. Whispering Smith loved Marion, a carefree, beautiful Western girl. His love was that of the strong, clean-living man, who knows no physical danger, but is reticent and bashful in his love affairs. Lacking as a suitor the characteristics that made him esteemed and feared among his fellow-men, he was beaten out for her hand by Sinclair, a dashing devil-may-care sort of fellow among the women, but an unscrupulous and vindictive man at heart. Marion's life with Sinclair was not all joy and happiness. Slowly he was killing her love for him, but in the manner of his kind he believed that harshness was the way to rule women. When the story opens, Sinclair, who is foreman of a wrecking crew on a mountain section of a transcontinental railroad, is living in one of the company's cabins in the small division terminal, \"Medicine Bend,\" a typical Western railroad and mining town. This town was located at the foot of a steep declivity, noted for the frequency of the wrecks occurring there, particularly among freight trains. The officials of the road were worried at the great number of the wrecks, but were more concerned with the robberies that took place after each collision. No trace of the thieves could be found. The railroad detectives had about given up in despair when Whispering Smith was sent to \"Medicine Bend\" to put an end to the robberies. Sinclair was never suspected. Smith, however, discovers soon after his arrival that Sinclair is the brains of the gang engaged in looting the freight cars. Smith, to save Marion the disgrace of having her husband branded as a thief, does not expose him, but causes the division superintendent, McCloud, to discharge him. Life for Marion soon becomes unbearable and she leaves him. This arouses to frenzy the desperate man, who plans to get revenge on the railroad by burning the \"Smoky Creek\" trestle. Assisted by several of the band who had been engaged in looting the cars, Sinclair sets fire to the trestle, causing a disastrous wreck. Smith, determined to capture the men responsible, discovers that Sinclair is at the bottom of the plot. Again his love for Marion induces him not to expose her husband until he talks with her. He effects a reconciliation between Sinclair and Marion and upon the former's promise to lead a better life and to leave \"Medicine Bend,\" Whispering Smith lets him go with his wife, and the girl he still loves.",

As a means of relief from his financial troubles he makes love to a brewer's widow, proposes, and is accepted. War breaks out between Turkey and Greece and he seizes the opportunity to dodge his trouble and a fiancée who does not appeal to him to go out as a war correspondent to Greece. It happens that a young American millionaire at the same time is sailing for Africa to hunt big game. On the same steamer are two charming girls who are going to the front as Red Cross nurses. One of them turns out to be the war correspondent's last wife; the millionaire immediately falls in love with the other. Arriving in Greece, the war correspondent finds dodging his former wife too strenuous and resigns his position. The millionaire offers to take his name and act as correspondent for him. From then on there are all sorts of comical misunderstandings and situations. Scene after scene is a riot of laughter up to the very end where misunderstandings are cleared up, the millionaire is accepted by the Red Cross nurse, and the war correspondent reunited with his former wife.",

    "description": "In March of 2017, America's deadliest city was rocked by one of the nation's biggest Police corruption scandals. Local hero and cage-fighting super-cop Wayne Jenkins was federally indicted on racketeering charges, along with six other members of Baltimore's elite Gun Trace Task Force. In a city stoked with racial tension and violence, Jenkins and his crew of plain-clothes detectives were celebrated for holding the Thin Blue Line. But they were actually terrorizing the city's Black community, working with a coke-dealing bail-bondsman to steal and redistribute millions of dollars of drugs, while brazenly planting evidence and falsifying police reports to frame their targets for crimes they didn't commit. They knew they'd get away with it because no one would believe their victims and the Police Department would always protect its own. But they didn't plan for a campaigning defense attorney named Ivan Bates or a secret FBI wiretap operation that would unintentionally bring them down. Based on the highly acclaimed book, I GOT A MONSTER, published by St Martin's Press, this documentary takes viewers around every twist and turn of this real-life cat-and-mouse game where the cops are also the robbers and those who are meant to protect our safety turn out to be the ones jeopardizing it.",

    "description": "\"Playing Sam\" is a semi-autobiographical independent film that follows the story of Samantha (Sam). As a non-Spanish-speaking Latina actress from the Bronx, Sam struggles to fit into Hollywood's narrow standards of beauty and ethnicity. When she auditions for the role of Anita in the Off-Broadway rendition of West Side Story, she delivers a cringe-worthy monologue with a noticeably fake Spanish accent, \"Antonio. What kind of fool do you take me for?\" she botches it, and the director, Ivonne Salaberrios, calls her out. But Ivonne sees the potential in Sam and gives her one last chance to deliver an authentic performance. With her second try, Sam channels her turbulent yet comedic love life for inspiration. An emotional rollercoaster ride consisting of narcissists and F Boys, she gets to the root of what it means to be your true authentic self. \"Playing Sam\" explores themes of heritage, mental health, and sexuality with a frank and unapologetic depiction of an empowered Latina woman.",

    "description": "Two women crave the love of the same man; one is pretty, proud, spirited, and poor; she offers him love. The other is equally pretty, proud, and spirited, but rich; she offers him everything money can buy. The rich one wins. This was not really the beginning of the rivalry of Madeleine and Jeanette; they had had petty differences in their home town when Madeleine, the poor girl, had refused to bend the knee to the other. But with this victory in love is born a new hatred, which Jeanette proceeds to intensify by having the other girl's father discharged from his position, thus forcing her to leave school and work for sustenance. Madeleine goes on the stage, and years later she is a popular actress. Jeanette, meanwhile, has discarded Paul, in favor of Henry Mortimer, a rising young lawyer to whom she has become attached. Mortimer becomes enamored of Madeleine, who considers him just another of her army of admirers and leads him on as is her custom. Jeanette sees that her rival is trifling with the affections of the man she loves. She goes to Madeleine and beseeches her to send him away or she will ruin two lives. Madeleine consents to her request, but then comes recognition all the old hatred returns. She retracts her promise and determines to marry Henry, though she does not love him, to strike at the heart of the woman who had caused her so much pain. After the marriage she is cold to the affection he showers upon her. Then her path crosses Paul's once more and her old love for him is rekindled. Henry learns of their association and orders Paul never to enter his house again. A new love is born in Madeleine's breast, the love for her husband. But there is a wide breach between them now caused by her associations with Paul and her gambling habits of which Henry disapproves. He refuses to pay her debts. When Paul calls on Madeleine for a loan, she refuses him and he rifles Henry's safe. That night, Henry notices the deficit and thinking his wife has taken the money to pay her debts, he accuses her of theft and leaves her. Rumors come to his ears that Paul is with his wife, and placing a revolver in his pocket, he starts for the house, intent on settling the affair. Paul, meanwhile, is trying, with small success, to regain Madeleine's love. When his attentions begin to get offensive, she threatens him with a revolver to keep his distance. Under the influence of liquor, Paul advances toward her, and stumbles over a chair, bruising his head. Madeleine rushes out to the kitchen to get some water, and, while there she hears a shot and returns to find Paul dead and Henry standing over the body. Each believes the other guilty and takes the responsibility for the crime. Henry is taken into custody; Madeleine's story is not believed. At the trial Henry is saved from dying for another's crime when Jeanette breaks down and confesses that she had been hiding in Madeleine's room on the day of the murder, and when the latter had gone for water she had grasped the opportunity to shoot Paul who, she said, had been planning to tell the truth in regard to the robbery. Knowing that this would bring about a reconciliation between Henry and his wife and that she would never be able to win his love, she had shot Paul and is now willing to suffer for her crime. Out of sorrow and suffering, come faith and love forged anew for Henry and Madeleine.",

In the beginning of his acquaintance with Angie, Williams proposes marriage to her, but later decides that it would be more to his temporal advantage to marry Mercy Mackey, the daughter of the owner of the mill. As the time approaches when Angie is to become a mother, Williams is accused of his perfidy by Mr. Mackey. The result is a violent, altercation during which Williams strikes Mr. Mackey and kills him, Angie being the only witness. The murder takes place in the mill yard, and as Mackey falls prostrate at the feet of Williams, Angie looks through the window of the mill and sees the crime. Due to her love for Williams she keeps the knowledge to herself. After the murder Williams forges Mr. Mackey's name to a paper, the purport of which is that it is Mr. Mackey's wish that Williams remain at the mill as the permanent manager. The forged testament also contains the wish that Mercy Mackey and Williams marry. Mercy has been secretly admired and loved by one of the mill foremen, Rufus Sweet, who, on account of the disparity in their stations in life, has not declared nor shown his love. At the time of the murder Rufus is accused by Williams. He is arrested, but is exonerated, and on his release he disappears. About the same time Angie goes away and leaves no trace. Meanwhile, Williams persuades Mercy to marry him. Rufus, who, in his new environment, has become an inventor of note and has amassed considerable wealth, reads an announcement of the marriage. He finds Angie, and together they return to their native town, arriving on the day that Williams is to marry Mercy. As the ceremony is about to be solemnized Angie interrupts the wedding and declares Williams is the father of her child, and thus makes it impossible for the marriage to take place. Williams then declines rapidly in the moral scale and his next misdemeanor is the robbery of the mill safe. He also decides to be revenged on Angie, and with this end in view he hires a gang of cutthroats to murder Angie and her baby. Angie is thrown into the rushing mill sluice, thereby being apparently doomed to certain and swift death. Rex, a wonderful police dog, belonging to Rufus, rescues Angie. At this part of the story Rex takes a leading role, as he not only is the means of rescuing Angie, but he also recovers the missing mill cash box. He is seen taking this box from under a pile of heavy stones, where it has been hidden by the robber. Rex is then seen as the chief factor in a most exciting cross country chase, in which he finds the gang of thugs in their retreat, which is a hut in the midst of the woods. He holds the men until the posse arrives, when they are arrested under circumstances of the most exciting sort. Williams is finally called to account for his various misdeeds, is arrested and sent to prison to pay the penalty which is exacted for all evil-doing. The story closes with the death of Angie, her last wish being that Rufus and Mercy marry. She clasps their hands together and her brave spirit departs, glad of its release from the pain-rack body.",

    "description": "Luke Simms is an honest politician: He is as charitable as he is honest and his greatest pleasure is found in giving excursions to the poor little ones of the slums. The nomination for mayor is refused by Franz Hargraves, on the score that he believes he would be expected to sign away the people's rights in favor of the Electric Company. Simms is nominated and finally elected, after declaring himself in favor of the people. Richard Sears, the leader of the corruptionists, presents a fraudulent bill to the mayor, who refuses to sign it. Sears then decides to get the ordinance passed by working on Simms' weak spot. Calling upon the mayor, Sears learns how the former's sweetheart was killed in trying to avoid running down a child while she was riding in an auto with him. Believing that he has found the mayor's weakness, that of his love of children; Sears returns home and tells his mistress, Florida Everett, that she must get acquainted with Simms and eventually marry him. Florida, a good woman at heart, longs for a decent, wholesome existence, and Sears tells her this is her chance to get it. Plans are laid to entrap Simms. The scheme works and Florida and Simms are married, and are living happily. Meanwhile Sears' stenographer, Nell, whom he has betrayed, gives birth to a child which dies a few days later. Under the assumption that he has now got the honest mayor in his power, Sears again presents the crooked ordinance, but again Simms refuses to sign it. The corruptionist then commands Florida to induce her husband to honor the measure, but she begs to be left alone. Sears threatens to expose her and she tries to get her husband to sign the bill, but he refuses. Learning of her failure, Sears sends her a telegram to meet him that night at Ardsleigh Towers, and signs it Ned Harter, who is secretary to the mayor and brother of Nell, the betrayed girl. Florida finds herself trapped, and she is kept there all night. When the mayor again refuses to sign the bill, Sears threatens to expose his wife. The corruptionist tells the mayor to find out where his wife spent the preceding night. Angered, Simms questions Florida closely, and in her anguish and fear, she begs him not to go to Sears. This decides him and he departs with vengeance in his heart. In the meantime Nell has returned to her brother. Ned drags the truth from her. He steals into Sears' home and, finding a revolver in a table drawer, extracts the cartridges and replaces the weapon, determined that his victim shall not have even a dog's chance. He secretes himself behind a curtain and hears Sears entering, and is about to shoot when the maid comes in. Simms calls and informs Sears to keep his wife's name out of their affairs. A fight starts, and just as Sears is about to stab Simms, who has the empty revolver pointed at the crook and who pulls the trigger, Ned fires unseen by the others and Sears is killed. Simms thinks he has killed him, and giving away to his grief, tries to revive Sears, and does not see the youth steal from the curtain, grab up the empty revolver and leave. Simms is arrested and indicted for murder in the first degree. Against his command, Florida takes the stand and bares her life. She relates how Sears deceived her when she was young and innocent, and of her continued bad life until she met her husband. The jury releases Simms, who, horrified at the thought of being a murderer, resolves to part from his wife, whom he reverences more than before. He does not consider himself worthy of her. Officer Ryan, ambitious for promotion, and suspecting Ned knows more than has been brought out, follows him and learns enough to make him suspicious. Simms has returned home and is preparing to leave. Officer Ryan follows Ned to Simms' house. Ned becomes alarmed and takes to the roof. Just as Simms is leaving, Ned rushes in, wounded and bleeding from the revolver of his pursuer, and confesses that he killed Sears. Ned dies and Florida and Luke are reunited.",

What she believes to be the site of an upcoming alien visitation in the wilderness of rural Canada. On their increasingly-surreal odyssey, Peter and Winona will encounter bickering lesbian cosplayers, shroom-addled survivalists, and even extraterrestrial highway cops. But the further they go and the more their trauma comes to light, it becomes clear that the only thing more nerve-wracking than being abducted is being alone in the universe.",

    "description": "Jimmy Conroy plans to marry Marna, stepdaughter of the wealthy Theodore Lewis, who disapproves of Jimmy as a son-in-law. His idea of a husband is Wally Henderson. Jimmy and Marna decide to elope. Jimmy cuts the tires on father's automobile and secures a rope ladder, while Marna packs up. Wally sees them eloping and informs father, who hustles him down to the train to prevent a ceremony until he can obtain injunctions and follow on the limited to serve it, Marna being under legal age. Jimmy has the marriage license, but has no time to get married before getting to the train. Wally takes the same train and lectures them on parental deference, but is shoved away. The train stops ten minutes at a way station. Jimmy rushes to the Rev. Tobias Tubbs, who is bathing. When he comes to the door, clad only in a bathrobe, Jimmy hustles him to the train just as it pulls out. Wally is on the platform and prevents them from boarding the cars. By the liberal use of money and I.O.U.'s Jimmy digs up a variegated costume for Tubbs and forces him along by hand car, mule back, afoot, and on the bumpers. After numerous adventures the limited, with father aboard, is flagged by Jimmy, who is thrown off, but pulls Tubbs up with him on the observation platform. He is about to be put off again when father pretends to be friendly. Instead he conspires with the conductor to have them arrested for stopping the limited. Meanwhile, Wally has convinced Marna that Jimmy has deserted her. She weepingly accompanies him to the hotel, there to await father's arrival. Jimmy and Tubbs are arrested when they disembark. Jimmy escapes and Tubbs is locked up. Father gives the injunction for service and has a scene with Marna. Jimmy has a hairbreadth escape from father and the officers as he attempts to get Marna from the hotel. Then he communicates by telephone and arranges for her to go to the city jail, where he will try to break in and Tubbs will marry him. Changing clothing with a sympathetic hotel maid, Marna eludes her guard and reaches the jail. Jimmy is sighted trying to break in, and a heart-breaking chase follows over rooftops, up and down the walls of buildings and over apparently unsurmountable obstacles. Mama, discouraged, is sent back to the hotel room. The search for Jimmy continues. He takes refuge on the telegraph wires overhead. Walking past several poles, he comes to one where a lineman is working. After explanations, the lineman agrees to help and makes a three-cornered telephone connection between Tubbs in jail, Marna in her room, and Jimmy on the pole. While the pursuers howl threats below, the unique wedding is under way. Father suddenly realizes it and dashes for the jail, arriving as the ceremony is completed. In conclusion, Jimmy is shown in his office settling I.O.U.'s. When alone again, he opens the vault, and out steps Marna into his arms.",

The professor, hearing gunshots and screaming, breaks Mathilde's locked door to find her bloodied, and the room in disarray, with papers of their studies stolen.

While Larsan investigates at the house, the professor's gamekeeper is murdered. Although clues lead to Robert, who, when arrested, refuses to explain his actions, Rouletabille returns from America to interrupt the trial with the solution to the mystery and prove that Larsan is the killer.",

John Harding, also well-born of wealthy parents, but disinherited, and a poor clerk, is also seeking his fortune in the gold fields. One day Harding receives a letter from a firm of London solicitors informing him that his father has died and that he is now Sir John Harding, Bart. He sets out at once to make his preparations for his return to civilization and to take up the station in life that is rightfully his. But that very day he becomes involved in a quarrel with Felix Strong, the young brother of a miner named Simeon Strong, and Felix is shot accidentally during the dispute. Harding is accused of murder, but flees to England in time to escape the vengeance of a posse, headed by Simeon Strong, who is determined to avenge his brother. Years after in London, Harding, who has married the girl both he and Cross were in love with before they emigrated, comes face to face with Cross and Strong, who have become partners and have \"struck it rich.\" In order to win Lady Harding for his own Cross allows the evil side of his nature to get the upper hand of him and plots to have Strong kill Sir John in a duel. Strong slaps Harding in the face in the foyer of the opera house in order that he may involve him in \"an affair of honor\" and avenge his brother's death by killing Harding. Cross in the meantime lures Lady Harding to his rooms where Sir John comes to seek her. She hides in Mark Cross's bedroom, but reveals herself at a dramatic moment when Harding, shouting \"Curse you, I'll kill you,\" springs at Cross's throat. Her splendid nature, as shown in her denunciation of both men, one as a husband without faith in his wife and the other as the would-be destroyer of a home, overcomes them with shame. They shake hands and Mark, parting forever with Lady Harding, orders his valet to pack his things for he is off \"on a long trail.\"",

    "description": "Cardinal Richelieu, for political reasons an enemy of the Queen, desires her downfall. He decoys Buckingham, of whom the King is jealous, to Paris by means of a forged letter. D'Artagnan leaves for Paris to enter the King's service. His father gives him a letter to De Treville and bids him \"Honor the King, obey Capt. De Treville and never refuse to fight.\" Poorly dressed, and riding on an old spavined white horse, D'Artagnan arrives at the Black Raven Inn, near Calais. He is insulted and jeered at, resenting which, he is beaten insensible and robbed of his letter by De Rochefort. Regaining consciousness he learns of his loss and starts in pursuit of the thief. The Cardinal issues an edict prohibiting dueling and gambling in public places. Boniface finds six Musketeers gambling in his tavern. He notifies the Guards, who surprise the Musketeers, kill three, wound Athos, and arrest Aramis and Porthos. Reaching the street, Porthos overpowers his captors and rescues Aramis. The Queen learning that Buckingham is in Paris, consents to see him secretly for the last time. Constance delivers the message. Boniface, her husband, observes this and reports the matter to Richelieu, who sets Lady De Winter to watch the Queen. D'Artagnan's first day in Paris is eventful. He manages to offend Athos. Aramis and Porthos and has three duels on his hands. The Three Musketeers are surprised to find they are all to fight the same man. D'Artagnan and Athos start to fight, but are interrupted by Capt. Jassac and four other Cardinal's Guards, who demand that all surrender their swords. The Three Musketeers cry: \"Come and take them.\" D'Artagnan sides with the Musketeers, quickly disposes of his adversary and saves Athos from being run through by Jussac, whom he disarms. Astounded by D'Artagnan's courage and swordsmanship, the victorious Musketeers welcome him as a comrade and with swords crossed pledge themselves: \"One for all land all for one.\" The King has quarreled with the Queen. Desiring a reconciliation, he presents her with twelve diamond studs. Buckingham is admitted to the Queen's presence by means of a secret passage. Lady DeWinter, unobserved, witnesses the clandestine meeting. She informs the Cardinal and he in triumph tells the King that Buckingham is with the Queen. The King proceeds to the Queen's apartment, but Constance warns her of his approach. Buckingham begs for a token and is given the first object at band, the diamond studs. The King arrives to find the bird has flown. Search is made without result and the King after threatening the Queen with the block, orders Richelieu to search the Queen's apartment and even her person if necessary. The search results in the Cardinal taking from the Queen's person an unaddressed letter. Richelieu hastens to the King and hands him the letter, but the King's rage is turned to laughter when he finds it is the Queen's brother, the Emperor of Germany, demanding Richelieu's dismissal. Defeated but not beaten, the Cardinal plots again, and dispatches Lady De Winter to London to steal two of the studs. The King, at Richelieu's suggestion, decides to give a state ball, and requests the Queen to wear the studs. The Queen, in despair, seeks Constance's aid, and she promises that her husband, Boniface, will take a message to Buckingham in London and bring back the jewels. Boniface not only refuses to be the Queen's messenger, but tells Constance that he is in the Cardinal's pay and suggests she give him the Queen's letter, so that he may obtain further reward. His request denied, he attempts force, but is frustrated by D'Artagnan. Boniface foiled, informs the Cardinal, who sends two of his guards to arrest Constance. D'Artagnan, not knowing Constance is Boniface's wife, is smitten by her charms, but Athos discourages him and tells him of his experience with women. Years before he had married Lady De Winter, then under another name, and by chance discovered she was a branded felon and hung her for deceiving him. Unknown to him, she had been rescued. The Cardinal's Guards attempt to arrest Constance, but D'Artagnan and Athos rescue her. Boniface being killed in the fight. D'Artagnan and Constance seek De Treville's advice, and he dispatches D'Artagnan to England with the Queen's message, ordering the Three Musketeers to accompany him and see to his safety. At parting Constance gives D'Artagnan a cross she has worn since an infant. Richelieu, learning of the plans, sends De Rochefort to Calais with orders to prevent D'Artagnan leaving England. On the road to the coast. D'Artagnan and the Three Musketeers are waylaid by a large force of armed men, who overcome the Musketeers, but D'Artagnan makes his escape. De Rochefort reaches Calais shortly after Buckingham has gone on board his ship, and the Port Warden, obeying the Cardinal's orders, has the portcullis lowered. Lady De Winter, provided with the Cardinal's passport, is aided to board Buckingham's ship. The Duke recognizes her as his divorced wife. D'Artagnan arrives, and is refused passage by the Port Warden, but binds and gags him and makes his escape in an open boat. He is fired upon and wounded by the Guards, led by the Port Warden, who has been released by De Rochefort. D'Artagnan reaches Buckingham's ship, and while the Duke is on deck interviewing D'Artagnan, Lady De Winter steals two of the studs. Returning to the cabin with D'Artagnan, Buckingham becomes suspicious and accuses him of being Milady's accomplice, and orders her put ashore. D'Artagnan produces the Queen's letter and swears by the cross Constance had given him that he is a friend. Buckingham recognizing the cross exclaims, \"The woman who gave you that cross is my daughter.\" Giving D'Artagnan the diamonds, the Duke discovers that two of the studs are missing, and decides Lady De Winter has taken them. To avoid capture, D'Artagnan decides to swim ashore. He dives through the porthole and eventually lands on a wild part of the coast. Seeking shelter at a tavern, D'Artagnan's gold arouses the cupidity of the landlord, who shoots and robs him and flings his body into the cellar. Lady De Winter returns to Paris sooner than expected and delivers the studs to the Cardinal. Believing D'Artagnan safe in England, the Cardinal influences the King to hold the ball two days earlier. The day of the ball arrives, with no news of D'Artagnan and the Queen is in despair. Endless crowds of courtiers and ladies are seen descending the grand staircase and a gavotte is in progress when the heralds announce the approach of the King and Queen. The stately procession enters and the King is about to lead the Queen to the dance, when the Cardinal calls attention to the fact that the Queen is not wearing the studs. The King insists that she wear them; the Queen returns to her apartment, where Constance offers to sacrifice herself by saying she had stolen the diamonds. D'Artagnan' s opportune return with the studs saves the day. The Queen returns to the ballroom, while D'Artagnan tells Constance that the Duke of Buckingham is her father and receives his greatest reward, herself. The King shows pleasure at the sight of the studs, but the wily Cardinal suggests he count them, and finding there are only ten, asks where the other two are. Lady De Winter produces them and tells the King how she obtained them. At this climax Athos recognizes Lady De Winter, and proclaiming her a thief, forces her to her knees, tears away her dress, exposing to the horror of all the brand of the felon. Her arrest is ordered despite her vain appeals to the Cardinal. The King realizing the conspiracy, banishes the Cardinal, and after asking her pardon, leads the Queen to the dance.",

Upon arriving in the city, Nell attracts the lascivious eye of stage manager David Montieth, who eventually gives her the starring role in a play with the expectation that he will be favored with her affections. Nell, however, has fallen in love with playwright Paul Neihoff. On the afternoon that the show is to open, Montieth learns of Nell's romance and cancels the show. Nell goes to Montieth's apartment to plead with him to open the show, and he consents after setting Nell's virtue as the price of her ambition. When he attempts to collect, Nell stabs him and rushes to Neihoff's apartment. The playwright tells her to go to the theater as if nothing has happened, writes a letter confessing that he killed the manager, and then takes an overdose of a drug and dies. Word comes to Nell after the second act that Neihoff has sacrificed himself, and in the last act, she substitutes a real dagger for the fake one and stabs herself to death. It has all been a story, however, concocted by the leading man to cure Nell of her infatuation with the footlights, and no one has died.",

Mills' care is a valuable document marked \"File 117.\" Capt. Mills invites the boys of the war office to his apartment to play cards. Jim goes but does not play. He amazes them by explaining that he possesses the almost uncanny ability to tell the value of his opponents' hand. Capt. Mills loses heavily. In a rage he accuses Jim of being a sharp, and that he has been assisting one of the players by coaching him from behind. Jim resents this, and in a quarrel that follows Capt. Mills throws a glass of whiskey in his face. Later, his friends convince the Captain that he was in the wrong and owes Jim an apology. The Captain apologizes, but decides to give him an impossible task to perform and thus discredit him. Capt. Mills goes to the war office that night and abstracts \"File 117\" and the next day instructs Jim to search for it. At the end of a week he rebukes Jim for his unsuccessful search. Capt. Mills and Jim are invited by Lady Marion to spend the weekend at her place in the country. Capt. Mills accepts the invitation, but Jim remains behind to continue his search. He meets a cabman who asks him to return a cigarette case the Captain left in his cab a week before. Jim questions the cabman and learns that the Captain went to the war office after the card game in his home. Jim breaks into Capt. Mills' apartment, and after drugging the butler searches the premises. He fails to find the missing paper. Jim then learns that Capt. Mills is going with the weekend party for a short cruise in the beautiful Grace Weston's yacht. He disguises himself and succeeds in getting aboard. The next day the yacht tears a great hole in her side, when she crashes into treacherous drift ice. The entire party and crew, excepting Grace and Jim, get away in the lifeboats and are picked up by a steamer and taken back to England. Jim picks Miss Weston out of the water, in an unconscious condition, and takes her aboard a life raft. They land on an island along the coast. When they become hungry Jim suggests that he try to catch some fish, and asks his companion if she can spare anything from her apparel to use for a fishing line. While unlacing a string from her corset, she accidentally drops the missing papers from her bodice, which Mills had given her to keep for him. She recovers the papers quickly, but Jim decides to get them. The next day Jim and Grace are rescued, and taken back to England. In the meantime Col. Brendon has heard of the missing file, and calls Capt. Mills to task. The Captain, thinking the papers are lost with Grace, and knowing that Jim is mysteriously missing, places the blame upon him. Jim arrives, tells the Colonel of his experience, and is promptly promoted. Capt. Mills is dismissed from the service, and Grace, learning the truth of matters, finds that she has a growing interest in Jim.",

This pleases Teddy, who now receives word from two lawyers, Teck and Kikal, executors of his uncle's will, to meet them at a hotel, These men are crooks and try to frighten Teddy so that he will sell the ranch cheap. They tell him a wild and weird take about \"Horned Toad\" and Teddy, all his life aching for such an experience, refuses to sell and declares he is leaving on the first train for the West.

She just misses him at his apartment and goes to Dorothy*n home, where Herbert Wendling a fortune hunter and suitor for Dorothy's hand, learns enough from Paprika to allow him to intimate to Dorothy and her mother that Paprika has been mixed up in Teddy's life, Dorothy refuses to believe the story, but her mother is skeptical. When they hear from Herbert that Paprika went West on the same train with Teddy, they immediately start for the ranch to protect Dorothy's interests. Arriving in the feet, Teddy starts looking around the town, in his evening clothes, in which he was dressed when put on the train by his intoxicated friends, and wine a full outfit of Western togs from a cowboy who in turn dons the formal costume.

Upon finding Paprika comfortably settled at the ranch, Dorothy, her mother and Herbert are about to leave for the East, when \"Horned Toad's\" gang raids the place.

Teck and Nikal plot to get Dorothy to sign over her interest in the ranch, and to have \"Horned Toad\" kill Teddy. They send a gang of Mexicans to capture Dorothy; they storm the house and, discovering the wine cellar get very drunk.

Dorothy is allowed to return to the ranch where she tells the cowboys of the incident and they swoop down on \"Horned Toad's\" men, but are held at bay. The Mexicans go to Teck and Nikal for their money and, upon being refused because of not delivering the girl, they mob the lawyers, who take refuge in jail.

    "description": "In a short prologue, Gunpowder Wetherill, a millionaire chemist, discovers the formula for making noiseless gunpowder and at once telegraphs Washington of his success. The War and Navy Departments tell him to take the formula and proceed to Hampton Roads, where all tests will be made. The secret of the discovery is closely guarded. But an indiscreet young under-secretary lets slip a stray word to a reporter regarding the new discovery and the newspapers seize upon it and make it public. Into an international conspiracy to rob Wetherill of his formula is thrust Hope Flannigan, a little slavey employed as a dishwasher in a small Sixth Avenue restaurant conducted by Gaston, a spy employed by a foreign government. He and his woman confederate, La Belle, receive instructions to gain possession of the formula. Wetherill has a daughter, Irene, and Gaston determines to obtain the formula and marry the daughter as well. But he reckons without the sentimental Madame Claire, cashier of Maison Gaston, to whom he has made love in odd moments. Madame Claire precipitates a quarrel which takes place in the kitchen of the restaurant. On Hope, however, unable to restrain her laughter, falls the weight of Gaston's fury and she flees from his wrath. On the same day, Irene Wetherill sets out to attend a meeting of the Big Sisters' Society. On the steps of the lecture hall she meets the prim old Misses Alstyn and their nephew Van, with whom she is in love. Van tells her that he thinks the play he has written is \"going over\" and if so they will have a \"dash to the altar.\" Van, on reaching the manager's office, has his play returned with an admonition to write about things as they really happen. Meanwhile the lecturer of the afternoon insists that no one is a true Big Sister unless she take a girl in distress into her own home and keep her there. Fired with enthusiasm, the Misses Alstyn, on their way home, meet the weeping Hope, whom they take home. Van, with very little money, feels he cannot marry, but Irene reassures him and begs him to try to go to Stormcliffs, as she and her father are leaving for a week's rest before going to Hampton Roads. His eye by chance lights upon an advertisement calling for first class waiters at the hotel where Irene will stop, and he decides to apply for a job to earn his board, disguising himself in his role as waiter and collecting local color as well for his play. He gets the job. Gaston, posing as Count Tomaso, and LaBelle as Mrs. Dardenell, follow them. Van's aunts decide to surprise their nephew whom they believe is stopping at the hotel as a guest, and descend upon him. They take Hope with them. The conspirators gain the friendship of Irene and her father, and Van, helpless in his waiter's garb, grows jealous. The arrival of Hope changes matters, for Gaston she recognizes as her old employer and walks toward him with hands outstretched in greeting. Gaston declares he does not know her and Miss Amelie Alstyn apologizes for her profusely. Hope unconsciously has won the admiration of Adolph, a bell boy. La Belle and Gaston plan to strike that night, Gaston gives her a tablet with which she is to drug Wetherill's wine. Hope, wandering alone, faces Gaston for the second time. He threatens to kill her if she breathes his name to a soul or tells of his meeting LaBelle there. LaBelle joins in and Hope, terrified, escapes. Van finds her and she tells him the whole story. Adolph sees her in conversation with the pseudo-waiter and tells the Misses Alstyn, who lock her in her room that night as a punishment. Van, meanwhile, comes face to face with Irene, who is angry at his neglect of her and tells him the Count is giving a dinner in his rooms for her and her father that night. Van is assigned to wait at the Count's dinner. After dinner Gaston takes Irene out on a small balcony and LaBelle drugs Wetherill's wine. Van watches, and when Wetherill becomes drugged LaBelle starts to rob, Van springing from his hiding place, accuses her, but she realizes that he can prove nothing. The glass is drained; the formula undisturbed. Irene and Gaston enter and LaBelle tells her that her father was taken suddenly ill. Gaston offers to go for help, but Van sends for the manager and detectives, declaring he has a witness who can prove who Gaston is. Then he starts to bring Hope. But Hope finding a note under her door from Adolph, begging her to climb down the ladder attached to the porch outside the room, and at Adolph's earnest proposal decides whimsically that she might as well marry him as go back to the \"two kind-hearted old funerals\" and elopes. Van, bursting into the room for his one and only witness, finds it empty. Wetherill is angry with Van for accusing LaBelle with whom he has become infatuated and Van returns home. Hope meanwhile arrives home with her new husband, and desiring to show him off to the girls in \"Gaston's old place,\" stops in there. There Madam Claire learns for the first time of Gaston's whereabouts and, insane with jealousy she brandishes a letter in which he promised to return and marry her and forces Hope and Adolph to go to him with her. Gaston writes to Wetherill asking his daughter's hand in marriage. Irene indignantly refuses, but takes the letter, and meets Gaston in the foyer. There as she talks with him Madame Claire looms up followed by Hope and Adolph. Gaston's identity is proven and he and LaBelle are arrested.",

Andrea, a worthless son, and a member of the notorious \"Red Galvin Gang,\" is a great burden on his father and sister. Nathan Marden, a wealthy banker, is attracted by the wonderful voice of Isola, the street singer, as is his son Charles Marden. Andrea, the worthless son, upon refusal of his continual demand for money, is overheard complaining by the gang, who send his father a black-hand letter, threatening destruction if their demands are refused. Charles Marden, unable to forget the street singer's wonderful voice and attractive appearance, solicits his friend David Mantz, a vocal instructor, to help him find the unknown artist. Mantz locates Isola and offers her vocal training, but her father will not hear of it, and she reluctantly declines. Franti, refusing the demands of the black banders, is killed by a bomb, and Isola and Andrea left alone divide their meager inheritance. After her father's death, Isola goes to Mantz and accepts his offer, not knowing that Charles Marden is interested, and is later on sent to Paris to continue her studies with Jean De Resni. The story of her entrance to the Paris opera stage, the longed-for opportunity and her success and popularity, are cleverly told on the screen. Charles Marden is present the night of Isola's debut. Enthusiastic over her success, he arranges a dinner party in celebration, and afterward, having partaken a bit too freely, he forces his attentions on Isola, and finally brutally tells her that she owes him everything for her success. Brokenhearted on learning this, she moves, leaving no trace. Meanwhile an offer has been received for her for the Metro Opera of New York. Every nook and corner of Paris are searched and she is finally located in poverty, singing at a cabaret entertainment. She returns to America, and at her debut at the Metro Opera House, Charles Marden endeavors to see her. and meets with refusal. His efforts later on are successful, and love shows the way to a happy marriage. Nathan Marden, the father, refuses his permission, but with the coming of Nathan Marden the second, the happy grandfather forgives. In the meanwhile, the worthless brother, Andrea, goes from bad to worse, and having located Isola by chance, demands money. Later urged by Red Galvin, the gangster, they plot to rob the home of Nathan Marden, Sr., who is killed in the robbery. Galvin is arrested, but Andrea, although wounded, makes his escape. He sends for his sister, and she, while searching for a bandage, discovers a scarf pin which connects Andrea with the robbery. Charles Marden suspects the frequent absence of his wife while nursing her brother, and traces her to Andrea's room where, misunderstanding the situation, he denounces her. He takes their son and leaves home, vowing never to return. Later, he reads of the death of Andrea Franti, and learns that he is Isola's brother, whereupon their love returns to build for future happiness.",

On the charge made by Margaret Warner, a struggling magazine writer, Kennedy disbars Attorney Doyle, contending that as a man must protect the honor of his wife and home, so must we guard our courts from prowling jackals. Because of his masterly handling of the disbarment case, a magazine requests Kennedy to write twelve articles dealing with the subject. Mary, his wife, persuades him against his wishes, to write these articles, suggesting that she will take his dictation on the typewriter. She proves an inefficient helper and the first night on which they work she falls and sprains her wrist, making it necessary for Kennedy to look elsewhere for assistance. Margaret, living in a cheap boarding-house is poor, as her short story manuscripts are returned day after day by the magazines. Desiring to help her Kennedy engages her for the work. Doyle, forced out of his profession, continues his work in the field of crooked-stock jobbing, taking the hard-earned savings of the poor for bogus mining stock. The last night of their joint work, Kennedy accompanies Margaret home, but on their way they are caught in an accident. Kennedy escapes injury, but Margaret faints. Calling to her to speak to him, Kennedy, with Margaret in his arms, rushes to a physician. Is the girl he is beginning to love to be thus taken from him?",

In the main story, Conchita Cordova sings in the cathedral choir in her village of San Miguelito near the Rio Grande. Millionaire oil man John Rannie, whose oil fields have displaced the peasants, desires Conchita, and when he learns that her fiance, Juan Mendoza, has been employed by Adolf Wylie, a German spy, Rannie threatens to expose Juan unless Conchita gives herself to him. Although disillusioned, Conchita decides to save Juan, but as she removes her cross, Rannie is moved by her sacrifice, and begs forgiveness. Meanwhile, the villagers, incited by Wylie, set Rannie's fields on fire. When Juan, thinking that Conchita loved Rannie, throws her cross in the fireplace and places it on her breast as a brand of shame, she rebukes him. After Conchita saves Rannie from being burned by the villagers, he kneels beside her in church. In Rome, Valerain kneels before St. Cecilia.",

It has a parallel story set in ancient Rome with a woman named Cecilia and a man named Valerain, and involves sacrifice and forgiveness. There's a scene with a cross and a fireplace, and villagers setting oil fields on fire. Looking for a film with these elements, possibly a classic."

Irving's disregard for others and his blind selfishness are also displayed in his daily life and affairs with other women. When Payne, Barbara's brother, arrives with his bride Muriel, it evolves, after a painful meeting, that Muriel is one of the victims of Irving's disregard for others, in the past. Realizing Muriel will keep the past a secret from her adoring husband, at all costs, Irving torments the girl unmercifully. Barbara, meanwhile, has learned that her husband's mode of living is not all it should be, and misunderstanding a situation between Irving and Muriel, openly accuses them. Then the truth comes out and Muriel proves her innocence in the past. Irving, enraged, trumps up a countercharge of scandal between Barbara and Schuyler. An estrangement at once follows between all concerned. At this time a terrible fire breaks out in Irving's tenements, in which Barbara is holding a party for the slum children, which little Harry is attending. All rush to the scene, and in his mad attempt to rescue Harry Irving needlessly sacrifices his life, for the boy had already been carried out in safety. His death is a just atonement for the lives lost when his rusty old fire escapes crumpled up under the weight of the mad rush of tenants and crashed to the ground. Barbara effects a reunion between Payne and Muriel, and a brighter future seems in store for herself and Schuyler.",

    "description": "When the body of Col. S.F. Hargraves was found in a room in the rear of Cradelbaughs, a gambling house, with a bullet in his heart, the police found \"Big Jim\" Pemmican, the manager of the place, coolly pacing the floor when they arrived. Jim demanded that the district attorney be informed. When District Attorney Murgatroyd arrived Pemmican led the way to a lounging room where stretched full length upon a couch was J. Lawrence Challoner, a young clubman, in a drunken stupor. \"He is the man who murdered the Colonel,\" Pemmican told the district attorney, who aroused the clubman and began questioning him. While Murgatroyd was telephoning his office for an assistant, and Pemmican was directing the arrangement of overturned furniture in the main gambling room, Challoner manager to make his escape. A city-wide search for Challoner was ordered by the district attorney, but no trace was found of him. Challoner had intended to go home to his wife, but as he walked through the side streets realized that he would be walking into a trap, so he turned and made for the East Side, finally bringing up in a cheap lodging house off the Bowery The next day he telephoned his wife and asked her to bring his funds and said he intended leaving for Europe on a freight carrying steamship out of Philadelphia. She advised him against this and pleaded with him to give himself up. With her fortune of half a million dollars she could hire the best legal talent in the city for him, she pointed out. Murgatroyd was greatly surprised when he arrived at his office and found both Challoner and his wife waiting for him. She asked to speak with him alone, after Challoner had been turned over to an officer. In his private office Mrs. Challoner made a deal with Murgatroyd to the effect that he would clear her husband's name. For this he was to receive securities that she held valued at half a million dollars. At the trial both Challoner and his wife were amazed when Murgatroyd prosecuted the case in a vigorous manner. And while the trial was in progress he even spent one night with Challoner, giving him the \"third degree,\" and finally obtaining a confession from him. This confession was introduced at the trial the following day, and together with Pemmican's testimony and the testimony of a maid, who had heard Challoner and Hargraves quarreling in Letty Love's apartment, made a case that convinced the jury of Challoner's guilt. Challoner followed Murgatroyd into his office and threatened to expose him tor accepting a bribe. \"I promised to save your husband,\" Murgatroyd said, \"but 1 did not say when or how I would save him.\" A few weeks later Pemmican got into a row with some gamblers in a rival house. One of the men shot Pemmican got into a row with some gamblers in a rival house. One of the men shot Pemmican, and when the physician reached his side, they told him there was no hope for his recovery. Pemmican sent for Murgatroyd, who was told that it was he who had killed the Colonel, who with Challoner was fighting to gain Letty Love his ( Pemmican's) wife. Then the gambler died in the arms of his wife. Murgatroyd went to the prison where he saw Challoner and told him he had obtained a false confession. The district attorney arranged for Challoner's release and advised him to drop out of sight. In a modest little apartment on the East Side Challoner and his wife set up housekeeping. Everything was progressing nicely, until Challoner became discouraged and again took to drinking. One evening when he returned to the apartment after drinking heavily, his insistent demands for money roused his long-suffering wife to action. Instead of handing him the money, as Challoner expected, she drew a revolver from the folds of her gown and threatened to shoot him if he advanced a step toward her. It was a revelation of his wife's character and Challoner fell to his knee and began to cry like a child. It proved the turning point in their lives. Challoner never drank again, after this his wife confided a secret to him. A baby is soon to be born to them. Challoner became melancholy and said: \"I cannot bear the thoughts of having a little one come into the world, the child of a murderer.\" When they arrived home from their little walk they found Shirley Bloodgood, one of the few society girl friends of Mrs. Challoner, who had remained steadfast during her trouble, They insisted on Shirley remaining to dinner, and that night the trio discussed many matters of the past. For Shirley was engaged to marry Murgatroyd, and she had tried to use her good offices on Challoner's behalf on several occasions. What became of Mrs. Challoner's fortune had always been a mystery to her friends, and during the course of the evening Shirley inquired of Mrs. Challoner where it had gone. Against the wishes of Challoner, his wife told Shirley that the money went to obtain her husband's freedom. \"Mr. Challoner, I think you have made a mistake,\" Shirley said at last, \"You know that any man who would take the last penny a woman has is capable of doing anything. How do you know that the confession Mr. Murgatroyd obtained was not real? I would never stop until I found out.\" The very next day Challoner set about on a quite investigation. Within a week he did find out that the confession was genuine, and that Murgatroyd lied to him. It required but little time for Mrs. Challoner, Shirley and Mr. Challoner to arrange a joint call upon the district attorney. Murgatroyd merely smiled when the trio swooped down upon him with their charges. After hearing a recital of their feelings he went to a large safe in the corner, opened it and took out the securities that Mrs. Challoner had given him. He had never touched them from the day he had received them. \"There is every penny you gave me, Mrs. Challoner,\" he said. \"I think you will all thank me when I explain. And I'm going to be very frank. It was Mrs. Challoner's money that made a fool and idler of her husband. He needed to be set right, and drastic treatment was necessary. There was plenty of manhood in him, but he had to be put through the fire. I realized that the only way to save Challoner was to reduce him to poverty. There have been times when my heart ached for him, and I wanted to tell you all the truth. I could tell you, but what's the use? I think we all understand now.\" That night at Sherry's there were covers laid for four, and it was a merry party.",

    "description": "Blanche Scott, a famous actress married to rich lawyer Martin Scott, is living happily in New York, but her cousin Elsie is married to Frank Edmonds, a performer who mars her happiness through infidelity. Blanche invites Elsie to stay with her, and induces her husband to procure a divorce for Elsie. Blanche's blind grandfather George Moore lives with them. Previous to her marriage to Scott, Blanche met with an automobile accident in which both of her parents were killed, and from the shock she became mentally deranged, but shortly afterward recovered. At the birth of Blanche's first child Viola, her attack of insanity returns. Physicians declare her case hopeless, and she is confined to an asylum. Her cousin Elsie adopts Viola. Two years elapse and Blanche is still at the asylum. Meanwhile, Elsie has secured a divorce from her husband. During this time Scott makes advances to Elsie, but is repulsed. Scott's love for Elsie prompts him to bring suit for an annulment of his marriage to Blanche on the ground of her being insane prior to his marriage, and he succeeds in having his marriage annulled. Blanche, in her hallucinations, raves both of her child and of her past successes on the stage, and very often sees herself playing her favorite roles of various classic plays, in which she starred. Scott, assuring Elsie that Blanche's condition is hopeless, is successful in winning Elsie's love, and in due course of time, they are married. A year later Elsie gives birth to a boy. All are overjoyed, except the blind grandfather, who still lives with Scott. The moral wrong, though legally done to his grandchild Blanche rends his heart with sorrow. Six years later: All are living happily, having forgotten the past. One day Scott receives a letter from the superintendent of the asylum, notifying him that Blanche has unexpectedly recovered and is in a condition to be taken home. Scott shows the letter to Elsie, who insists that he bring Blanche back. Scott refuses, but Elsie fervently pleads with her husband to gratify her wish. He still remains obdurate. Moore, overhearing Elsie's plea, cautions Scott not to tell anything to Blanche for the time being, as it may cause a relapse. Scott, convinced by the prudent advice of the blind old man and Elsie's pathetic appeal, finally yields and brings Blanche home. Blanche's joy upon her return is somewhat dampened by her former husband's coolness. She suspects that there is some secret in the house, and questions Scott, Elsie, her grandfather, and the servants, but gets no satisfactory reply. Baffled in her efforts she at last questions her own eight-year-old daughter Viola, who tells her the truth. Elsie, wishing to sacrifice her own happiness for Blanche, decides to go away with her child, Eddie, but Blanche, realizing that she cannot live under the same roof with her former husband, prevents Elsie from leaving. The ex-wife then seizes a knife near at hand and attempts to cut her throat, but is prevented by Scott and Elsie. The furious rage and wild excitement again disturb her mental balance, and she is pronounced incurably insane. Blanche, while being led to the ambulance, wildly calls for Viola. Moore, sunk in unutterable grief, goes to her, but his suffering is beyond human endurance. He is overcome by his emotions, stricken with heart failure and dies. Blanche, seeing him fall, breaks loose from the physicians and rushes madly to the prostrate form of her grandfather, kneels over him, imagines that she performs the scene of La Tosca, where she kills the Baron and laughs hysterically.",

    "description": "Who has reared the perfect child? Who has successfully combated the destiny-shaping factors of heredity and environment with a theoretical code of child-raising warranted never to fail? Mrs. Gretchen Jans, mistress of millions, failed. Her two pretty nieces, Frances and Clarice were taught to sew and mend, economize and retrench, not alone in clothes and money but in thought and emotion as well. \"Plug up the fountain of youth,\" was the harsh, Puritanical code of Gretchen Jans, and Frances paid the penalty with her heartaches. Hence, when Richard Ward fell in love with Frances and Mrs. Jans refused the parental blessing, the young couple did what most young couples do, set off post-haste for the nearest parsonage. And then into the life of Frances came the great change. A comfortable allowance didn't reach. Money ran like rays of sunshine in a golden stream through the fingers of both hands. Richard couldn't keep up the gait. Bills payable increased with a monotonous regularity only equaled by the decrease of his bills receivable. Credit weakened, the specter of poverty grinned through the office door and the riotous waste of the girl who had been denied continued unabated. And then came the second man with his offer of money and the trail of suffering and self-abasement that followed in its wake. It seemed all very innocent to Frances but it was tragedy to Richard.",

    "description": "At the beginning of hostilities, Tom Winston, despite the pleadings of his sister Ellen, an ardent Confederate, goes North and acquires a commission in the Federal Army. Frank Carey has entered the Confederate service, though his sister Ethel, furiously denounces him as a traitor, and asserts her intention of herself serving the Union. Both girls become identified with the secret service department of the South and North, respectively. Tom is with Grant, Frank with Johnston, and the armies' movements bring them into the neighborhood of their homes. Tom has with him Don, a dog that had been used in the old days to carry messages between his master and Ethel. Union headquarters are established in the Winston home, affording Ellen an opportunity to acquire many valuable secrets which she communicates to Frank, and it is the belief that some officer is proving a traitor. Tom watches his sister closely, and one night observes that as she sits merrily chatting with the Union officers, she is using her fan in such a manner as to make the dots and dashes of the Morse code to Frank, who is concealed in the shrubbery, making notes of the information. Tom discovers Frank, overpowers him, and succeeds in taking from him the memoranda, but allows him to escape. Tom places the memoranda in his pocket. The Battle of Shiloh has begun and Tom is given an important dispatch, ordering up supporting brigades. He proceeds on his mission, but is pursued and badly wounded. Unable to go on, Tom gives the dispatch to Don, telling him to carry it to Ethel. Don does his part, and Ethel undertakes to deliver the order. She is hotly pursued by Confederate cavalry, and only escapes by jumping her horse from a cliff into the river, a deed which none of her pursuers will attempt. They do not fire upon her, but wave their hats and cheer as her horse swims the stream and climbs the other bank. The dispatch is delivered, and the reinforcements begin a forced march to the assistance of the Federals. Meanwhile, Tom has been picked up by a Federal party, unconscious, but not dangerously wounded. The memoranda taken from Frank is found in his pocket, and it is concluded that he is the supposed traitor. A drum-head court-martial condemns him to he shot. The battle is now raging fiercely, the victorious Confederates pressing steadily forward. The Federal position is carried. Tom is captured and sent to the Confederate rear, where he succeeds in eluding his guards. Despite the sentence hanging over him, he determines to rejoin his troops. Johnston is killed, the triumphant advance of the Confederates falters. Tom reaches the Union lines, he rallies a breaking regiment and leads a fierce charge. The tide of battle is turned; Frank is captured. The battle lulls, the Confederates sullenly withdraw from the field. Tom is immediately arrested and placed under guard. Frank learns of the fate in store for Tom, and to save him, confesses himself to be the spy, Tom is released. Frank is held as a spy, but cleverly effects his escape. Frank goes to his home to attempt to induce his sister to go South with him, as he must accompany the southern army further into the Confederacy. Tom has gone to see his sister, to endeavor to induce her to give up her dangerous work as a Confederate spy, and has been captured by a squad of Confederates while at his home. He sends a note to Ethel informing her of his situation. Ethel secures several Federal troopers and makes her brother a prisoner. Under a white flag, Ethel and her squad approach the Winston home, and Ethel proposes an exchange of prisoners. This is agreed to, as well as a temporary truce; then Tom and Ethel turn to the North, while Frank and Ellen ride away into the Confederacy.",

Daniel Whitcomb, Cuttleback's leading attorney, reads with interest the notice in Cuttleback's newspaper about Mrs. Lehr's intended return, and ponders the romance that connected his and her life before she left for the West. He wonders if her return will awaken the old-time affection he felt she once had for him. He remembered that before she left Cuttleback she asked him to see her, but his mothers desperate illness prevented him. He had written, but his letter did not reach her until she was the wife of another. She replied informing him of her marriage and hinting at her disappointment in his not having seen her before she left, but absolving him from any intention to purposely slight her. It happened that Mrs. Lehr and Mr. Whitcomb did renew their old love story. While this goes on, her little girls make things hum around the estate and tax old Job's patience to its limit. The girls form a warm attachment to slow-witted handyman \"Manny,\" who finds time between chores to amuse them and become their faithful attendant. One day Job's belongings are removed from his room and the faithful old gardener drops out of sight, on a day when a barn on the Lehr estate is destroyed by fire. A charred skull found in the ruins forms the basis for a murder charge brought against dull-witted Manny by the town constable. Mrs. Lehr believes him guiltless, but can't prove his innocence, and the children \"just know\" he never killed Job or anybody else, but, like their mother, can't prove it. Mrs. Lehr seeks Daniel Whitcomb's aid, but he refuses her plea and states his belief that Manny is guilty. This breaks up his love affair with Mrs. Lehr and earns him the dislike of her daughters. Manny is tried and convicted, wholly upon circumstantial evidence, and he's being led to the electric chair when the girls arrive with the supposed victim Job, whom they had accidentally found and who knew nothing of Manny's predicament. Everything is cleared up and Katherine and Jane get a new daddy.",

His mental mood has worried his friends and when his true condition of mind is disclosed by the discovery that he is reading a book entitled \"Famous Suicides,\" action becomes necessary. One of Van Seer's club friends has recently visited a fortune teller, known as \"The Mysterious Mrs. M.,\" and relates his experiences to Van Seer. As a result of the combined urgings of his friends, Van Seer visits the sorceress. When she tells Van Seer that on a given date be will meet with a painful accident while out of doors, Van Seer hopes to thwart whatever truth there may be in her prognostication by remaining indoors, at his club, all day. Despite the invitations of his friends to venture forth, Van Seer sticks within his room until late in the afternoon, fire is discovered in the clubhouse and, with the other occupants, Van Seer rushes forth. Just as he is crossing the threshold, he trips, falls headlong to the sidewalk and breaks his wrist. He will have none of the attentions offered by the club physician, but takes his machine and rides to his country seat, where he submits his broken wrist to the treatment of Dr. Woodman, the family physician. Prompted by a desire to further test the abilities of the seeress, Van Seer again visits \"The Mysterious Mrs. M.\" She informs him that on a certain date, still three months away, he is to die suddenly. As a token of his disbelief Van Seer gives her an order on his executor to pay her an immense sum of money if he shall die in accord with Mrs. Musselwhite's prophecy. The fortune teller hands him back the order, stating that his money will do her no good as she is herself going to die within a week. Van Seer bribes the fortune teller's butler to keep him advised of Mrs. Musselwhite's health. On the day the woman has set for her death, the butler calls Van Seer to the phone and informs him that Mrs. Musselwhite has died. Being now thoroughly convinced of the woman's ability Van Seer contemplates the likelihood of his own death as specified, but now he wants to live. Dr. Woodman's daughter, Phyllis, has come home from college. Van Seer has fallen in love with her, but believing that his day of death is fixed by fate he refrains from advancing his own cause while all the time Phyllis is in love with him. So matters continue until Van Seer's last day on earth. He spends the hours alone, locked in his library, watching the hands of the clock approach the hour of midnight. When at last the hour of midnight arrives and passes with Van Seer still alive he is suddenly aroused to the realities of life by having his club friends burst in upon him with a letter from \"The Mysterious Mrs. M.\" She has, all along, acted in the employ of Van Seer's club friends and has prognosticated and acted along previously decided lines. Rejoicing in his good health, good fortune and the love of Phyllis, there is the happy ending of Van Seer's romance of life and death.",

    "description": "Episode 1: \"The Airship in the Night\" The first reel of episode one shows Stanley Hargreaves, father of Florence Gray, stealing up from his carriage to the entrance of the Susan Farlow Select School for Girls. In his arms he cradles his baby daughter. While his coachman awaits at the carriage entrance to the school grounds, Hargreaves makes his way across the lawn and terraces to the veranda of the institution. Tenderly he wraps up the child and puts it down in a spot sheltered from the wind. Cautiously he crouches up to a window of the office, where the matron of the school sits attending to her correspondence. A sharp rap brings Susan Farlow to the window. Hargreaves hurriedly steals back to his carriage and drives off. Puzzled by the tap on the pane Miss Farlow swings open the doors. Before her on the threshold lies a baby, wrapped in garments of expensive texture. Pinned to the child's silken outer wraps is an envelope and inside the letter a note and a gold bracelet. \"The name of this child is Florence Gray,\" the note reads. \"Take care of her and educate her. I shall provide liberally for her. The other half of the enclosed bracelet will identify me when I send for her.\" Seventeen years pass. Florence Gray has become a young woman and one of the most popular girls in the Farlow school. Throughout her girlhood she has never wanted for anything and from time to time liberal remittances and presents reach her from her parent. The scene changes to the home of Stanley Hargreaves, father of Florence Gray. Hargreaves, when a young man, had joined the Black Hundred. This was an organization of Russian millionaires. Circumstances made him an exile from Russia. Branded as a traitor by his fellows, the young millionaire knew that a price had been set upon his head. The passing of years had changed his appearance, however, and now, nearly twenty-five years after his departure from Europe, he hopes that the beard and the moustache he has grown, together with the changes which time has marked upon his features, have altered him beyond recognition. Feeling assured that he will not be remembered if he returns to his old haunts, Hargreaves determines to claim his daughter, dispose of his estate and servants, liquidate his holdings, and return to Russia. He sends a note to the Farlow school demanding the return of Florence Gray, settles his daughter's bills and then, to celebrate his departure, enters one of the most fashionable of New York's restaurants. He is recognized as he enters by James Norton, a reporter. Hargreaves invites the reporter to dinner and introduces him to Countess Olga Petroff and her companion, Braine. Hargreaves, as he sits down to dinner with the reporter at an adjacent table, little realizes that his nearby acquaintances, Braine and Countess Olga, are watching him closely and that they recognize in him the man for whom they have been commissioned to seek the world over. So sure are they of their identification that both hurriedly leave the restaurant for the local headquarters of the Russian secret society. There they inform resident members of the Black Hundred that they have recognized in Hargreaves a former member of their band and that the opportunity to wreak the vengeance of the Black Hundred is at hand. A picture of Hargreaves, taken in his youth, when he was a faithful member of the society, has come into possession of the New York chapter. This picture, now carefully preserved by Countess Petroff, is handed around among the band for identification. The conspirators, their faces covered with black masks, are sitting about a long table in a secret room when the Countess and Braine tap on the door and are admitted. Two members are delegated to spy upon Hargreaves while the rest mature their plans for his downfall. From the moment he leaves the Fifth Avenue restaurant Stanley Hargreaves is a marked man. One or another of the Black Hundred shadows him constantly. They watch him as he withdraws his wealth from the safe deposit vaults of a Wall Street bank; they learn through the unsuspicious servants of his preparations for a hurried departure, and they view from a distance his secret interview with Stevens on a Long Island aviation field. The first intimation that Hargreaves receives that his identity has been discovered is a note slipped under his door by Braine. The note warns Hargreaves that the members of the Black Hundred are aware that he has withdrawn his wealth from the bank and that he plans flight. They tell him not to try to escape. As Hargreaves, with trembling fingers, reads the note, he staggers back against the mantle in his library and there flashes before his mind's eye the picture of his introduction into the Black Hundred years before. He sees himself again a young man, clad in Russian garb, pledging himself, while he clasps hands with the aged president of the secret order, to devote his life and wealth to the promotion of the aims of the society. The note from the enemy causes Hargreaves to make a quick change in his plans. Hastily shaving his beard and moustache he dons a rough suit and, upon ascertaining that his home is surrounded, goes to the roof of the mansion and sets off a rocket to call Stevens to his aid. The rocket is seen by the conspirators as it roars up from the roof into the darkness. They determine to break into the isolated home of the renegade member of their band. They attack the massive entrance doors of the mansion with iron bars, dealing blow after blow that echoes through the mansion. In the distance Braine, the leader of the band, sees a balloon creeping across the sky toward the House of Mystery. Realizing that Hargreaves intends to escape in the car of the balloon the band redoubles its attack on the door of the mansion. As the balloon sweeps across the roof of the House of Mystery Hargreaves clutches at the basket. He manages to obtain a hold just as the big bag, struck by a sudden gust of wind, leaps into the air and is carried away over the tree tops. In his struggles to get into the basket of the balloon. Hargreaves is assisted by the pilot. The millionaire finally crawls up over the edge of the wickerwork car and falls exhausted on the floor. While the balloon drifts out over the ocean, back in the House of Mystery Hargreaves' butler does his best to cope with the members of the Black Hundred who finally manage to break into the mansion. The conspirators, upon smashing in the great front door at once run to the roof of the house just as the balloon skims away across the tree tops. Braine shoots at the big bag in an effort to puncture it. Shot after shot goes wild but finally one takes effect and the balloon is seen rapidly sinking toward the sea. Braine runs below to tell his fellow conspirators of his successful shot. He finds that they have hound Jones, the butler, and are giving him the third degree, in an effort to make him reveal where Hargreaves has hidden his wealth. But someone has already removed all the money from the safe built into the wall of Hargreaves' library, and Jones is able only to point to the empty compartments. Far out at sea a collapsed balloon bag drifts about on the wave tops, kept afloat by the wickerwork car and the few remaining feet of gas within the bag.",

    "description": "In the home of the stalwart young son and his mother, the girl rescued from the sea grows strong again after her fearful exposure. Her attractiveness, so different from that of the fisher maidens, has a telling effect on the young man. He asks her, at length, to become his bride, and she accepts. But a few days before the wedding the affianced bride disappears, sailing away with a strange man from the city, who has suddenly appeared. Thinking that his sweetheart had deserted him for another, the fisherman is heartbroken for a time, but gradually the keen edge of his sorrow wears away, and he succumbs to the attractions of another girl, one who had recently come to the village with her father, and who had lived together and alone at the end of the town. In reality, the runaway girl had been a thief. In trying to escape with a large amount of money which she had taken from the store in which she was employed, she had sailed on a boat which was wrecked. She was the only surviving passenger. The stranger, for whom she left her stalwart fisherman lover, was a detective, who had hit upon her trail. She bribed him with the money which she had saved, and he did not turn her over to the authorities. The detective, learning that the young fisherman would someday inherit a vast fortune, insisted that the girl return and persuade the youth to marry her. Between them they would secure possession of his money. The girl returns to the village, and tells her former lover that it was her brother with whom she had left, that they had hurried away to the deathbed of her dying father. While she talks, the fisherman's real sweetheart and her father surprise the detective in the doorway. At first he stammers in embarrassment. Then he looks searchingly into the face of the older man, and claps a handcuff on his wrists. The father, it seems, is a fugitive from justice. Seeing a chance to accomplish his ends, the detective promises the daughter that if she will give up all claim to the fisher youth and allow him to marry his earlier love, her father will be set free. She sorrowfully agrees, and the youth, much against his wishes, consents to the sacrifice. But the wadding is again interfered with. As the bride, ready to start down the stairs looks over the rail, she sees her former employer, the man from whom she had stolen a fortune, talking earnestly with the fisherman. Thinking that her secret has been divulged, she flees down a back stair, jumps into an automobile, and starts off, heading straight for the quicksands. The unhappy girl who had given up her own happiness for the sake of her father, tries to warn her of her danger, but, thinking it is a plot to stop her escape, she rushes ahead, and is swallowed in the treacherous sands. A letter from headquarters verifies the honesty of the unjustly accused father, and the girl and the fisherman wed and are happy ever after.",

Dorothy is engaged to Reggie mainly because of his money, and is flirting desperately with all comers. While out in his automobile one day Reggie chances upon a lost little girl sitting on the curb. He takes her back to her home in the slums and there he sees and falls in love with Agnes Shannon, a sweet young girl of good family now compelled to earn her living in a cheap cabaret. He then discovers that Dorothy is faithless to him and breaks his engagement, leaving him free to pay court to Agnes. His rival for the affections of Agnes is Tony Bernard, the leader of the gangsters of the neighborhood, and Bernard has instructed one of his henchmen to bring Agnes to him. Reggie frustrates the scheme, beats up the henchman, and the owner of the dive in which Agnes works hires him as his bouncer. But Bernard has not given up the idea of possessing the girl, and as Reggie is the only obstacle in the way of getting her, he orders him shot. They way-lay Reggie, but he beats them up one by one. Cornered at last, Reggie challenges Bernard to enter a room alone with him and have it out, the man who survives the battle to get the girl. Bernard agrees. A fight takes place. The light is smashed, but it continues until the two men, their shirts stripped from their back, are too exhausted to go on. By a supreme effort Reggie deals the final blow and staggers out, where he is attacked by the band. But the police have been tipped off. How Reggie finally wins Agnes is the culmination of a romance.",

    "description": "John Ashton, a young mechanical engineer, is completing the plans of a new submarine. The government is interested in his work, and he has promised to have it done by the tenth of the month, which gives him only six days in which to complete it. More and more he has been resorting to whiskey to keep his brain active. Robert Gray remonstrates with him, but to no avail. His fiancée, Grace Sealey, telephones him and urges him to attend a dinner party on the ninth. He accepts, though against his will. He falls asleep and dreams that he prepares to attend the dinner; he is still intoxicated when he arrives. Grace's father at once breaks off the engagement, and he leaves the house in disgrace. He goes home and finishes his plans on the morning of the tenth, and then, still wearing his evening clothes, wanders out into unknown streets. He goes into a saloon on the waterfront and drinks until he is insensible. There he is noticed by the captain and mate of a freighter, and shanghaied on board the vessel. When he comes to his senses he is far out at sea, and is told that the cruise will occupy six months, but that he may have all he wants to drink. At the end of the cruise Ashton and the captain, coming ashore, take a farewell drink together. Meg, a human derelict, attracts the captain's attention, and he attempts to force his attentions upon her. Ashton comes to her assistance, angering the captain, who gets two stevedores to attack him. Meg takes him to her own meager quarters and takes care of him. Gradually she induces him to stop drinking. Passing the building where he formerly had his office, he sees Franklin Darrow, a government engineer, and Gray, and hears them speak of Grace's wedding. She is to marry Wilfred Carleton, a broker, thinking Ashton dead. The news sends Ashton back to drinking heavily once more. But Meg learns of his real identity and helps him to win back his self-respect. They are married and Ashton's ambition returns. He resumes his work and seeks out his former friends. But Meg is unused to the new life. Her husband's work takes him more and more away from her, and she decides to take radical measures. Since he fell in love with her when under the influence of drink, she induces him to drink again, preferring his society in idleness and sordid surroundings to his neglect in luxury. The new plans for the government's submarine are made while he is intoxicated. They are wrong, and the crew of the first boat launched is drowned. Meg confesses what she has done, and takes the blame on herself. He flies at her throat, and waking up, knocks over the things on his desk. His original plans are as yet unfinished. He puts from him \"the devil at his elbow,\" whiskey, and he and his fiancée have an early marriage, with the promise of a life full of achievement and ambition that is not clouded by an enemy which steals away the brains.",

Slade is a man filled with ambition, but his wife is contented and absorbed in her love for her husband. By a fortunate accident he discovers a gold mine, and with his newly acquired wealth, immediately sets out to make a position of influence for himself in the world. His aggressive personality and ability at once attract attention, these qualities being combined with wealth, and the possibilities of a political career are pointed out to him by Senator Strickland. Slade has no sooner established himself in his new surroundings than he comes to feel that his wife does not know how to take advantage of their altered circumstances. She is still the same simple, home-loving person. In the course of time he becomes attracted to the Senator's daughter, who, like himself, is of ambitious temperament. In fact, though she does not love him, she agrees to marry him if he obtains a divorce from his wife. The concluding episodes of the story show how the wife rescues her husband from his unpardonable folly, and how, much chastened, he finally persuades her to come back to him. He has now become the chief executive of the State and Mary at last takes her place as the Governor's Lady.",

Impressed by her talent, he offers her free instruction if she wishes to come to Paris. Bianca accepts and promises to send for Rose as soon as possible. In Paris she meets Etienne Du Inette, head of the Internationale, a powerful secret service organization. He and Bianca are instantly attracted to each other. Jules Lavinne, also in the service of the Internationale, goes to Corsica on a secret mission. He sees and desires Rosa. One day a mysterious veiled woman slips a note under Etienne's door, warning him to go to Corsica and watch Lavinne, who is a traitor. He soon has occasion to protect Rosa from Lavinne. Lavinne learns the assumed name Etienne is using on the island and signs it to a note asking Rosa to meet him. In Paris, Bianca finishes and exhibits her first piece of work, and it is purchased by a wealthy patron. She sends for Rosa, but a letter from old Maria tells of the girl's disgrace and attempted suicide. Bianca rushes to her sister, who is dying. She finds the note which lured her sister to her destruction. It is signed, \"Pierre Renard.\" Bianca vows to follow Pierre Renard \"To the Death.\" She meets Jules Lavinne, and instinctively dislikes him, but when she learns that he belongs to the Internationale she forces herself to be gracious to him, hoping that he will aid her in finding \"Pierre Renard.\" Lavinne, determined to win her, avoids meeting Etienne. Bianca asks Lavinne's aid, and he promises to find the man for her if she will marry him. Having vowed to avenge her sister at any cost, she promises. That night Lavinne telephones that he has a photograph of Pierre Renard. Bianca asks him to bring it to her at once. Before he comes he writes a note which he instructs his man to deliver to Etienne. It reads, \"Bianca is in great danger. Go to her at once.\" Lavinne engages tickets on the midnight train, and tells his valet to take his portmanteau to a prominent hotel, where he arranges to have a priest ready to perform the ceremony. He shows Bianca the photograph. She is speechless with horror when she sees that it is a picture of Etienne. Lavinne instructs her to ask him whether he was not known in Corsica as \"Pierre Renard.\" When he arrives she does so, and he admits it, also admitting that he knew Rosa there. She plunges a dagger in his breast, and he falls to the floor. Unwilling to keep her bargain with Lavinne, she attempts to take her own life. Lavinne prevents her, and forces her to accompany him to the hotel where the priest is in waiting. No sooner is the ceremony performed than Lavinne boasts of having won her by trickery, saying that it was he himself who lured Rosa to her death by the use of the name \"Pierre Renard.\" Just then the valet knocks at the door, and Lavinne admits him. Behind him follow the woman of mystery and two gendarmes. The woman is Lavinne's wife, and he is arrested as a bigamist and a traitor. He returns to Bianca the dagger with which she struck down her lover. She rushes back to her own apartment, to kill herself beside his body, but she is amazed to find him gone. Her old nurse leads her into the room where he is lying asleep. The medallion of herself worn over his heart has saved his life.",

Kulbir Thapa, a 26 yrs old Rifleman in the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles, was in one of the leading companies venturing deep into German lines, and it was the first time he had been under fire and short-lived hope of survival was all gone when he was severely wounded. A survival story behind the enemy line itself is a praiseworthy tale of bravery but his story didn't finish there. What unfolds next is a legendary tale of self-sacrifice, compassion and friendship. The next day, on 26th September, for a fleeting moment, midst burnt and grime filled no man's land, he displayed much greater heroism than war- humanity. This earned him the first-ever Victoria Cross for Gurkhas but most importantly, on the day, it brought both British and German together, to acknowledge the sheer willpower of Gurkha.",

The boy's life is a drab one until, in an effort to escape his sister's wrath, he runs into a graveyard where he is seized by an escaped convict, Provis, who threatens him with instant death if he does not give him food and a file with which to remove the ball and chain from his ankle. Pip does as he is bid, only to have the convict captured and brought to the blacksmith shop, when poor Pip nearly expires for fear he will be apprehended. But the grateful Provis lies to save him. The next step in the history of Pip is the arrival of Mr. Jaggers, a London lawyer, who is so struck by his gentility that he selects him as a companion for Estella, the adopted daughter of his client, Miss Havisham, a most secretive and peculiar woman. The companionship of the two youngsters ripens into love as they grow older, until Pip learns to his dismay that Miss Havisham has deliberately encouraged them with the purpose of breaking his heart. The young lovers are separated and Pip is made the beneficiary of a legacy which enables him to go to London, live as a gentleman and be thoroughly educated. He does not know the source of this income, but believes that Miss Havisham is secretly making amends for her cruelty. He finally discovers the whereabouts of Estella and they plight their troth. That night Pip is dashed to the depths of despair by the arrival of Provis, the convict, who reveals the fact that it is he who has been supplying Pip with money. The poor boy believes that Estella will scorn him when she learns the truth, but he has reckoned without the finer qualities of Estella who comes to his assistance and even helps the convict in his fatal effort to escape the police. Over his dead body there arises the vision of a new romance as the two young lovers pay homage to the better side of this remarkable man's character.",

Our audience experiences an intimate revelation, the truth behind the beautiful, chiseled, public face. We celebrate a radical and pioneering woman of profound influence, who doesn't fit into any of the 'boxes' expected of her. Throughout her life, she wears various female identities: daughter, sister, actress, beauty, wife, girlfriend, victim, superstar. It takes great loss and hard won insight to be happy just being Kate. Call Me Kate is also a movie for the outcasts, the misfits, the girls and boys uncomfortable in their own skin, who don't conform with traditional expectations. It is the universal story of how - like Kate - we must be true to ourselves, not the forces that shape us.",

The pressures of just trying to survive in the big city are already enough to drive people into extreme physical, emotional and mental conditions. These extreme conditions can cause humans to lock-up in every way. In this documentary, Finding Bliss: Fire and Ice - The Director's Cut, we get a group of well-known but reserved musicians and music students from the bustling streets of Hong Kong and send them halfway around the world to the natural landscapes of Iceland, Fire and Ice. Through connecting and sharing with the people of Iceland and ultimately themselves we hope through this little adventure of music, games and culture can provide a different P.O.V to add to their experience in life. The goal is to ease the pressure off their physical being through opening their eyes, mind and soul so they can hopefully get to UN-lock themselves a little more, feel a little lighter, feel a little happier and feel a little bit more of what they call bliss.",

Helen Barrington, possessing a secret attachment for Grey, finally becomes his wife, when he realizes that his affection for Miss Fenton can be of no avail. After her marriage to Vaughan, Clara, unable to subdue her deep love for Grey, at every opportune moment appears in his company, endeavoring to continue her love affair with him, despite the fact that she is now married. At a dinner she gives, Peter Vaughan is shocked to observe his wife's carrying-on and her persistent advances to Grey. At a climax, his attention being called to the affectionate attitude assumed by his wife toward Grey, his heart gives way, he collapses and expires. In widowhood, regardless of the fact that Grey now leads a happy married life as a beloved husband and father, she pursues her wiles and attention. Being repulsed by Grey, she conceives a plan of inveigling him with the aid of Ashton Cameron, in the purchase of Avalanche mining stock, and then to cause the market to drop, reducing Grey to all but ruin, coming to his assistance with her extreme wealth, raising the price of stock and restoring him to affluence. She engages in this plan, believing that thereby she will place Grey under everlasting obligations to her, and possibly serve her ends in having him abandon his wife, to assume relations with her. By various tricks and subterfuges, she arouses the suspicions and jealousy of Mrs. Grey, until the moment arrives, when, believing that her husband is carrying on a secret liaison with Mrs. Vaughan, she determines to divorce him. Grey's young sister Rose is in love with Philip Carlton, and throughout the entire play, reigns as the standby of Grey. Ashton Cameron, also in love with Rose, offers to assist Grey out of his difficulties on Avalanche stock, providing he uses his endeavors to procure Rose's consent to marry him. Grey refuses this assistance at the sacrifice of his sister's future happiness, and Cameron proceeds to carry out his agreement with Mrs. Vaughan to ruin Grey. Polly, a street waif who is injured in an accident by Grey's automobile, is adopted by him into the family as his charge. In the denouement at a gathering at the office of Shaw, Grey's family lawyer, Polly reveals that she has observed Grey repulse Mrs. Vaughan, and declare to her that he loves his wife and will have nothing to do with her. Mrs. Vaughn is confronted with the proof of her various intrigues and diabolical schemes to arouse Mrs. Grey's jealousy, and finally admits the true situation and her own despicable actions. Grey is reconciled to his wife, and Clara Vaughan is left to pursue her way in the world, rejected and alone.",

    "description": "Dr. Fred V. Kammacher, a young physician living a short distance from Berlin, has been disappointed in his bacteriological researches and to add to his mental and physical distress, his wife, Angele, develops symptoms of brain derangement. The couple are the fond parents of three children and when Dr. Rasmussen, the family physician advises that Angele be taken to a sanatorium, Kammacher is threatened with a general breakdown. He reluctantly consents to the pleadings of his mother to seek rest away from his home and makes his first sojourn in Berlin. While there he accepts an invitation from an old friend to attend a matinee performance, at which Miss Ingegerd Halstrom, a famous danseuse, appears in her latest creation, \"The Dance of the Spider.\" Kammacher falls under her charm and is introduced by her father after the performance. But he is disillusioned when he finds her bestowing her attention indiscriminately upon the gallants who surround her. He leaves in disgust and upon later receiving ill tidings from home, departs for Southampton, where he engages passage on the liner \"Roland,\" bound for America. He is seeking to forget the troubles that beset him. Through a curious twist of fate, Ingegerd and her father also have taken passage on the same steamship and Dr. Kammacher, upon the renewal of the acquaintance, finds himself more closely attracted toward the young dancer. Dr. Kammacher is sorely puzzled over the whimsical nature of Ingegerd and during one of his trouble slumbers dreams that he has landed on the island of Atlantis, the mythical realm which, according to the ancient Greeks, disappeared under the crest of the sea, only to resume its activities on the sands at the bottom of Neptune's domain. Here he meets old friends and is enjoying their greetings when a violent shock rouses him from his slumbers. In a dense fog the \"Roland\" has struck a hulk and water pours in volumes into her hold. The boiler room is flooded, but the stokers stick bravely to their posts and officers and crew exert every effort to restore calm among the passengers. Realizing that hope is fast fleeing, the captain orders the life boats lowered and in an instant pandemonium reigns on board the doomed vessel. Scantily clad passengers from the saloon scramble to the upper deck, while the panic stricken emigrants in the steerage madly trample each other in their wild frenzy to reach the boats. Fearful of delay, scores plunge into the angry ocean seeking rescue from those in pitching life boats. A watery grave is the fate of hundreds and gradually the \"Roland\" lists and sinks into the bosom of the relentless ocean. With difficulty, Dr. Kammacher rescues Ingegerd, but her father is among the victims. For many weary hours, filled with mingled hope and despair, the little group huddle together in the life boat, the men taking their turns at the oars. Toward morning the tossing craft is sighted by a cargo steamer bound for New York and Kammacher, Ingegerd and their fellow survivors are taken aboard and start again toward the New World. Sandy Hook, the Statue of Liberty and the impressive skyline of New York are vividly depicted and finally the steamship pier, where the rescued are besieged by newspaper reporters anxious to learn the particulars of the sinking of the \"Roland.\" Unthan, one of the survivors, otherwise known as \"The Armless Wonder\" is the center of a curious group while Dr. Kammacher is taken in charge by Will Snyder, an artist and an old-time friend of the young physician. Fate decrees that Ingegerd at this point drops out of the life of Dr. Kammacher. It is related that she repeats her success as a dancer and in a whirl of gayety soon forgets her fancied attachment for the man who had saved her life. From the hour of his arrival in America, the sojourn of Dr. Kammacher is varied and filled with innumerable moments of interest. Dr. Schmidt, an old friend, invites him to seek rest in his mountain cabin, standing among the snowdrifts beyond the Canadian border. He accepts, but before leaving pays his farewells to Eva Burns, a young sculptress, whom he had met during one of his rounds of the studies in company with Snyder. Fever overtakes him in his mountain retreat and almost at the same time he receives news of the death of his wife. Miss Burns nurses him back to health. The story does not end at this point and while the finale may be guessed at, the evolving of the details supplies a number of strong and appealing scenes.",

When he reaches manhood, Chiapa is given authority over his entire tribe. He falls in love with the priestess, Tecolote, and she yields to his advances although she is quite unworthy of him, and encourages other suitors. Then the Aztecs hear that under the white god the Tehuans are very prosperous, and start forth to conquer them. The Aztec army is under command of Mexitli, the chief general of Montezuma, the Emperor, and having conquered the Tehuans, he carried off Tecolote as his personal slave. Chiapa follows as a spy. In the garden of Montezuma, he is wounded by a guard, but Lolomi, the beautiful daughter of the Emperor, saves him. They fall in love. Meanwhile Mexitli has tired of Tecolote, and now seeks the hand of the Princess Lolomi, who would rather die than have him. As the Emperor gives Mexitli his consent, he tries to get the princess by force, and in doing so discovers Chiapa. Luiapa is sentenced to die at the end of the year on the sacrificial stone. But Lolomi, finding her pleas to her father of no avail, sends word to the Tehuans that their god is captive. An avenging army sweeps down, and there is brought about a sequence of thrilling scenes with a smashing finish.",

The ship owner, discovering the real state of affairs, and desiring to part the lovers for reasons of his own, persuades Robert to sign for a six months' cruise aboard his vessel, the \"Venus.\" After the ship has been out for several weeks, it is reported lost with all hands on board. The ship owner is pressed by Mr. Johnstone, his principal creditor, for a bill for $10,000, which Johnstone offers to cancel if Eleanor will marry his son. Eleanor is coerced into this alliance, and she, believing Robert dead, and anxious to save her father from ruin, accepts the proposal. Meanwhile, Benjamin, the only survivor on board the \"Venus,\" is discovered in a dying condition by smugglers, who ransacked the vessel for plunder, and he is taken to their cave in a desolate island, resuscitated and made one of them against his will. One day the yacht of Mr. Clark, multi-millionaire, approaches the island, and to please the whims of his little son, a rowing boat is sent to the shore where the smugglers surprise the party and kidnap the child. While the terms of ransom are being made, Robert manages to send word to the yacht that he will save the boy and himself as well, which he successfully does, and, as reward, receives from Mr. Clark, a check for $10,000. Robert arrives home the day before the marriage of Eleanor to Johnstone's son. At the church door next morning, Eleanor recognizes Robert in the crowd, a scene ensues, and she is taken home ill, before the wedding takes place.

    "description": "Whispering Smith, a railroad detective, is sent to Medicine Bend to suppress the looting of cars. Smith meets two childhood friends, Murray Sinclair and his wife, Marion. Smith's arrival kindles an old spark of love in Marion's bosom. Sinclair is discharged for looting wrecked cars and Marion leaves her husband when he threatens to ruin the road if he is not put back to work. After trying for weeks to get an interview with Bucks, general manager of the railroad, Murray Sinclair and his followers, Du Sang and Karg, are granted an audience. They state their side of the case. Bucks refuses to put them back to work. He says that McCloud was right in discharging them. Sinclair becomes violent and tries to attack McCloud but is prevented by Whispering Smith. During the scuffle, Du Sang manages to secure a wire that has just been delivered to McCloud. The wire reads: \"Notify Dunning Cattle Co. shipment of $65,000 delayed till No. 10 Friday.\" They decide to hold up the train, get the money, and leave the country. In the Three Horses saloon Sinclair plots to kill McCloud before they hold up the train and Du Sang agrees to do it for him. Tony Wickwire, the Mexican whose life McCloud saved at the Central Mine, walks up behind them and overhears their plan to kill his friend. He shadows Du Sang. Du Sang takes his place at the window of a hotel and waits for McCloud to pass. Wickwire hides behind a lamp post and when Smith and McCloud appear, he warns them in time to save them from Du Sang's bullets. Du Sang thinks McCloud is dead and repairs to a gambling house. Smith, Wickwire and McCloud follow him there. Smith tells him he must leave town or he will \"rope him like a cow and drag him down Front Street.\" The following day Sinclair, Du Sang, Karg and three other followers hold up Number Ten, and kill the messenger. Before he dies, he tells that he recognized Sinclair in the gang. McCloud, notified, starts to the scene of action with the sheriff and a posse. Whispering Smith takes Wickwire, Lloyd and three other men and starts for Williams Cache to head off the bandits there. In the meantime the gang has split into two factions; Sinclair and two followers have decided to leave the country and Du Sang, Karg and Sam have decided to go back to their rendezvous, Williams Cache. Before starting out of the state, Sinclair turns a switch against the relief train which he is sure will be sent out. The train runs into the open switch and crashes through a string of cars on the siding. The posse get out their horses and start in pursuit of the robbers. They finally run them down, but Banks, the sheriff is killed. They return to Medicine Bend with him. Du Sang and his men beat Smith to the cache. Rebstock, who controls the cache, refuses to help Smith run down Du Sang, so Smith and his men start to round up the cattle that have been stolen and hidden there. They clean out the cache and then Smith, Wickwire and Lloyd start after Du Sang. They meet and a fight follows in which Du Sang and Karg are killed and Sam taken prisoner. Lloyd sees Smith thrown from his horse and thinks he is dead, so he rides to Medicine Bend for help. Marion hears him say that Smith is dead. She is carried to her house where she lies ill. Sinclair and his men return to Medicine Bend the same night. Sinclair insists that his wife accompany him out of the country. She refuses. He is about to kill her rather than leave her for Smith, when the doctor arrives and tells him to get away, before the town learns he is there. Sinclair takes his advice. That same evening Smith rides into town with his captives. On his deathbed Banks gives Smith the warrant for Sinclair's arrest and tells him to serve it. After several days of trailing them, Smith and Wickwire came upon them in an arroyo drinking from the stream. They dismount and Wickwire starts to skirt out around to take them on the flank. After Wickwire leaves, Smith shoots and kills two of the men leaving only Sinclair who manages to wound Smith in return. When Smith falls, Sinclair sneaks through the brush and coming upon Smith, tells him he is going to kill him. He reloads his revolver and is about to shoot Smith, when Wickwire reaches a higher spot of ground and sees it all. He draws his revolver and fires at Sinclair killing him before he has pulled the trigger, and Smith's life is saved. When Smith is well enough to travel, he goes to see Marion. They come to an understanding and are married.",

    "description": "Dr. Guy Hartwell, a young and wealthy Louisiana physician, was a man of strange personality. Five years previous to the opening of the story he married and bestowed sincere love upon his wife. In return she basely played him false and shortly afterward died. From that moment he was a changed man. Embittered against the world, mankind and even distrusting God, the silent and melancholy man lived on. With the doctor lived his widowed sister and her daughter, whom everyone considered as the heir of the physician's wealth. In the same city lived Beulah Benton, who was sent from the orphan asylum out into the world to earn her living as a servant girl, while her little sister Lillian found a home as the foster daughter of a rich lady. At the orphanage Beulah learned to love Eugene, another inmate, but he, too, was adopted by a wealthy family and sent abroad to be educated. He promised upon his return to make Beulah his wife. Beulah yearned to see her sister, but Lillian's foster parents forbade the two to meet. This affected Beulah deeply, but the crushing blow was about to descend. Lillian fell ill, and in spite of every effort of Dr. Hartwell the younger sister died. Beulah, seeing the crepe on the door, forced herself in and for the first time met the doctor. The kindness of his nature was reawakened by the grief-stricken girl, and he took her to his home, attended her through a serious illness, then placed her in school. But Beulah found her new surroundings far from pleasant. While the doctor as yet refused to trust any woman, he treated her with marked respect and consideration, but his sister fearing that the adopted girl would become the heir instead of her own daughter, lost no opportunity to humiliate Beulah. It was more than she could bear, and at last the girl sadly left the doctor's house and returned to the orphanage, but the doctor, however, brought her home again and provided other quarters for his sister and her daughter, both of whom were wholly dependent upon him for support. The years passed and Beulah's lover, Eugene, returned from Europe, a dissipated wretch, his love for the orphan girl forgotten and his hand pledged to the frivolous niece of Dr. Hartwell's false wife. The physician warned the foolish youth to give her up, pleading with him to remain true to his promise to Beulah, but without avail. It was now that Hartwell realized that he himself loved her and declared his affection. Beulah expressed her great gratitude, but still grieving over her false lover told him that she could not return his affections. Hartwell went North and Beulah became a school teacher. An epidemic broke out and people were perishing by the score. Doctor Hartwell returned to the stricken city. The doctor and Beulah met and side by side they fought the ravages of the disease. Clara Saunders a friend of Beulah's fell in love with Hartwell but becomes a victim of the plague, and with her departing breath joined the hands of the two, and bade them be happy. Through comradeship with Beulah, the doctor's faith in God and Man was restored, and his life made still brighter by her voluntary confession of her love for him. Their marriage followed, and Beulah and her husband fearlessly faced the future.",

Zoe gets up a flirtation with Craig and allows him to call upon her. Their friendship soon ripens into love. The Rajah, suspicious of the pair, sets one of his servants, Singh, to spy upon Zoe in her apartment. Singh is present behind some portieres during a love scene between Zoe and Craig, and when Craig has gone. Zoo discovers the presence of someone behind the curtain. Thinking it to be the Rajah and mad with sudden passion, Zoe stabs the supposed Rajah and then rushes from the room. On the stairway she meets the Rajah, alive and well. With him she returns to the room. Singh's stabbed body is discovered and the Rajah tells her that unless she marries him the next day, he will have her tried for the murder of his servant. Zoe decides to flee to America. She is accompanied by a faithful Indian servant, Khula. She leaves behind her a note for Craig, telling him to follow her at once. After a bitter scene with the Rajah, Craig does so. In America Zoe and Craig are married. The warmth of her husband's love and the intimate appreciation of his character through her associations with him, brings to the heart of Zoe, the realization of her own unworthiness as his wife. Craig has married her without any knowledge of her past. Zoe decides that Edith, the daughter of her Cousin Mary, is perfectly fitted for the honor and duties of Craig's wife and plans to disappear from Craig's life before her happiness shall be shattered.

Edith who is not the sweet young girl Zoe has fancied her, but a greedy, designing young woman, finds the note and contrives to have it reach Craig. In the meantime Zoe, accompanied by her servant Khula, has gone into the secret chambers of the old home, waiting for an opportunity to disappear from the country. She has left her valuable jewels as an heritage to Edith. Celeste, a model posing for Craig loves him and is jealous of Edith. She causes suspicion to be directed towards Edith that points to the murder of Zoe, and not death by burning. Edith is arrested but in the investigations attending the accusations. Celeste's share of the trouble is discovered, and Celeste, Craig and Edith are arrested. The Rajah, intent upon revenging himself upon Zoe arrives from India at the same time. A mob from the neighborhood of Zoe's home, aroused at the rumors of foul play, make an attempt upon Craig's life, accusing him of the killing of his wife. With the mob at his very heels, Zoe, who has been wounded in her struggle to reach her husband, appears at the last moment, clearing Craig of the charge. The Rajah's threats are made harmless, by Khula's dramatic insistence that he killed Singh. Zoe assured that her attempted sacrifice has been wrong, finds happiness in Craig's affections.",

    "description": "Katherine Bradley, known as \"Kit,\" is an orphan and heiress. At an early age she is placed in a fashionable and select seminary for young women. Kit, by means of her fascinating daring, her unlimited cash, and her lovable personality, enlists the cooperation of all the girls in any affair which she undertakes. She so impresses the principal of the school with her open-heartedness that she is given permission to drive her car from four to five o'clock each day. The story opens on the day of the annual play given by the young women of Miss Smythe's Select Seminary. The question passes from mouth to mouth, \"Where's Kit Bradley? She's our leading man.\" A search is instituted which results in finding a note in Kit's room saying that she has taken her car out for a drive. The principal is horrified that her charge should be out without a chaperon, and determines that such an action shall not be repeated. In the meantime, Kit, speeding along the country roads far from home, has an accident. A tire is blown. Kit is perplexed. Then a handsome young man comes along and offers assistance. She accepts it, and promises to meet him on the next afternoon. This arrangement is not carried out quite as Kit planned. Arriving at school very late in the evening, she finds it necessary to enter through an open window. Quickly slipping into a kimono to cover her street clothes and getting into bed. Kit faces an indignant principal who enters her room, with a story of a nerve-wracking toothache which keeps her awake. The next afternoon when Kit would take her usual spin, Miss Smythe reminds her that she must take a chaperon. Kit takes her, but makes the ride so hazardous that the chaperon, when told that the car is not the kind that can go slowly, is glad to be left by the wayside, while Kit takes a spin and returns for her. Kit keeps her tryst. Among the trees she and Cameron enjoy a picnic luncheon, but while this meal is in progress a passing tramp sees Kit's classy new roadster, likes it, and takes it. Cameron takes her in his car and on the wayside they pick up the outraged chaperon, who believes not a word of the little story and hurries the culprit to Kit's guardian. To save herself, Kit announces that she is engaged to the artist, and this is confirmed by Cameron. Brought before the guardian, he recognizes in Cameron an old-time friend, gives his consent, and after reciting a passage from the will of Kit's father that her fiancé must not see her for six months after the engagement, disappears in time for Kit and Cameron to become really and truly engaged. The idea of not seeing her newly found fiancée for six months, is not to Kit's liking, besides, she is just a bit jealous, for he is an artist. So Kit persuades her guardian to take her to a performance of Elsie Janis in \"The Fair Co-Ed.\" From the production she obtains an inspiration that determines her future course of action. Kit changes clothes with a servant and enters Cameron's studio as a slavey. Toddling back and forth in the performance of her menial duties of serving and dusting, she keeps an eye on Cameron and notes those who are constantly coming and going. They are stylish; they are beautiful; they are cultured. Then, too, there is in the studio a fascinating blonde model. Kit must change her tactics and be some or all of these things. She will be beautiful. For surely he, with his artistic temperament and taste, will most appreciate that quality. She, too, will be a model. As Carlotta, the Queen of Italian beauties, she agrees to pose for Cameron. And then, just for the sheer joy of it, and because in Miles Smythe's select school she had learned the art as \"leading man,\" Kit arrayed herself in all the paraphernalia of an up-to-the-minute \"chap.\" She visits the studio and by flashing unlimited coin and even boasting about the large sums she has \"on\" her. Kit proceeds to win the affections of the beautiful blonde who has been flirting with Cameron. Cameron has seen through the little disguises all the while, but now that he is confronted by a \"man,\" he feels licensed to treat him as a man. He smokes a vicious cigar, blows smoke in Kit's face, and presses her to drink with him. This is too much; she will reveal her identity at once, will or no will. \"Guardy,\" passing Cameron's studio, recognizes Kit's car standing outside, and without ceremony enters and stands behind the young couple as Kit commences to reveal to Cameron her real identity. He sees the lay of the land and makes to them an unexpected and startling disclosure. There probably never was such a wedding. What an assembling of rarely beautiful girls and brave courtly men; a canopy of unflecked blue mountains standing black against the sky and extending off into misty nothingness and great stretches of green and flowers. Kitty was at last married to Cameron.",

    "description": "Osgood and Short are promoters floating stock in a fraudulent tropical rubber plantation among the residents of a New England community. Their best prospect is Elizabeth Mann, a wealthy widow, who is kept from investing only by the influence of her rather effeminate son. To get him out of the way the promoters offer to send him to the tropics to manage the plantation. David, having been brought to a realization of his worthlessness through a curt refusal of marriage, accepts, and is soon landed in the tropics. He meets Senora Morales, a Mexican slave dealer and her daughter, Consuela. They are just departing to deliver a number of slaves to Ludwig Hertzer, the most feared and hated planter on the Isthmus. David gets an insight into Hertzer's peculiar character, and the horror and brutality of the rubber slavery system. Next morning Senora Morales and Consuela arrive with the slaves, among them a big Yaqui chief, to whom Hertzer's half-breed daughter is attracted. Going on to his own plantation, David finds that it is little more than a rubbish heap and sends a cable to his mother not to invest, but this is intercepted by Hertzer for his personal gain. David's housekeeper, Andrea, is a wild, sensuous daughter of the tropics, and endeavors to appropriate David to herself. David turns his attention to reforming conditions and building up the plantation, especially after he hears that his mother has invested in the company. Crazed by the unspeakable brutality to which they are subjected on Hertzer's plantation, the Yaqui chief and his sister escape. In the flight the sister is killed by Hertzer and the following morning the Yaqui is captured, taken back and terribly flogged. Andrea's fight to win David reaches a climax when, after he had ridden by a stream and had seen her bathing, he yields to the lure of her dancing and love-making that night. They are interrupted by cries of yellow fever and, as David goes to attend the sick man, the slaves and Andrea, after looting the hut, follow them. After writing a letter to Morales for more slaves, David is himself stricken with the fever. Morales being away from home, Consuela brings the slaves. Hertzer accompanies her and nurses him back to life. While nursing the sick man, Hertzer schemes to have David removed by Osgood and Short so that he may manage the plantation and divide the spoils with the promoters. Consuela assists David in his reforms by opening a school for slave children. David asks her to marry him. She agrees, providing his mother consents. At that moment Hertzer brings a letter authorizing him to take charge of the plantation, and, as David speeds back to New England to gain his rights, Consuela stays on to try to protect his interests. Hertzer urges Consuela to marry him. In answer to her query as to why he has been so brutal, he explains that because years ago native bandits killed his wife and stole his baby, and this had so warped him that he thought only of revenge. In New England David secures control of the plantation, while his mother writes to Consuela urging her marriage with David. Patricia obtains the letter and shows it to Hertzer, who is so enraged that he locks her up in a hut and, after a night of drinking, starts to wreak his vengeance on her. Drunk, he wanders into the jungle, where he falls unconscious. Returning home, Morales finds that Consuela is at Hertzer's, and starts out for her, with David, who has just returned. Morales is killed. That evening Hertzer goes to the hut and attacks Consuela. She is saved by the arrival of her slave. Patricia pleads with Hertzer to give up his plan, but Hertzer locks her up in another hut and goes back to Consuela. He now plans to mate her with a slave. The slave is brought in, but Consuela is again saved by an uprising of the slaves. A battle ensues between them and Hertzer and the overseers. Hertzer is left helpless on the ground by the Yaqui chief, who, to avenge himself for the death of his sister, carries off Hertzer's half-breed daughter, Patricia. The slaves burn the plantation and Hertzer, a physical wreck, plans his worst revenge. If he cannot have Consuela he determines that no one else shall, and crawling to the hut, he sets fire to it, to burn both of them. David, nearing the plantation, sees the flames and rescues Consuela. Carrying her out, he adds mental anguish to Hertzer's death by telling him that Consuela is his own daughter. He revives Consuela and all ends happily.",

They decide that Joe, the most eligible partner, should marry and give them an heir. This Joe refuses to do. However, Bud and Bill set about to find a suitable wife for him. Their efforts are unrewarded, and Joe, in disgust, leaves town. Geraldine Kent, daughter of a poor but aspiring society woman, accepts the invitation of a friend to take a western trip. The mother, of her own invitation, accompanies them. Arriving at the hotel, they discover Joe in an undignified position on the floor playing with a youngster of five. The mother is shocked, but when she learns that Joe is wealthy, she is attentive to him, and persuades Geraldine to accept his proposal of marriage. Joe's lack of polish is such a source of constant embarrassment to him and his wife that his suggestion to Geraldine that they run away from it all is gladly accepted. Discovered by her mother just as they are about to leave, Joe is enlightened by Mrs. Kent's expression of her sorrow at forcing Geraldine to marry such a boor because they were so sadly in need of money. Heartbroken, Joe gives them the money and departs. At the end of a year, Geraldine sues for divorce. Bud and Bill leave Hoorah City for a trip to see Joe's baby. Not until Joe reads in the paper an account of the divorce proceedings does he know that he has a son. He also starts out to see the baby, and the three men meet. Both Bud and Bill claim the right to be the namesake of what they consider a \"partnership baby,\" but learning the little one is a girl, they order at once baby wardrobes by the carload.

Geraldine has learned that Joe's greatest desire was for a child, and when he accuses her of marrying him for his money, she meets it with a statement that he married her for the baby. He suggests that she take the money and he the baby, but as the little one starts to cry, he is frightened, and hands it to the mother. As they look at the baby, and then at each other, they realize how foolish they have been, and Joe takes both mother and child into his arms.",

At their headquarters, in the Gila Mountains, in consultation with \"Ace High,\" his lieutenant, he plans depredations on the neighboring settlements. Although Hudspeth is powerful, their rule is disputed by El Salvador, a half-breed, and his following of desperadoes. Desert Pass is the scene of many conflicts between the contending bands. Rumors of the arrival of miners with gold causes El Salvador to send \"Cactus\" Fuller, his henchman, to levy tribute by a hold-up, which is successful. Flushed with triumph, he boasts in the \"Golden Fleece\" saloon of the ignominies to which he would treat Cliff Hudspeth if he ever met him. Hudspeth arrives and makes Cactus, whom he throws out of the saloon, realize that something must be done to retrieve a shattered reputation. Coming out of the saloon, Hudspeth sees Norma Wright, a milliner, standing at the door of her little store, and waves her inside, as he anticipates trouble. The shooting commences and Cactus is defeated. As Hudspeth is preparing to leave town Norma denounces him as a cold-blooded murderer. Stung almost to madness by the girl's accusation, he seizes her and gallops out of town. At his retreat he locks the stupefied girl in a room and seeks to drown the memory of her words with whiskey. The whiskey, and his awakened conscience, bring him to review his life, and, half delirious, he sees his victims pass reproachfully before him. The girl, too, becomes aware of the human side of the man and next morning she brings him around to her way of thinking and extracts a pledge that he will never willingly kill another human being. Soon after there comes from a member of the legislature offer of a pardon and restoration to citizenship if Cliff will undertake to rid Arizona of El Salvador. Hearing of Cliff's new appointment, El Salvador is wild with rage, and burns the town and drags Norma away to the mountains. Cliff Hudspeth rescues her and kills El Salvador, although mortally wounded himself. He places the girl on a horse, which bears her to safety, and passes away consoled that his last killing was in her defense.",

    "description": "Eight hours is not a very long time, yet it completely changed the lives of a girl and a man. A man's life was fanned out by fate, criminals were caught and punished, and a battle of wits took place, while the mystery baffled New York City. The Earl of Valletort insisted that his daughter, Lady Hermione, marry a Hungarian Count. The Count saw a clear path to the throne of his country. Money was necessary; he must have wealth; thus his choice of Lady Hermione. The Earl himself had no money. When his wife passed away she left every dollar, and a big estate it was, to her daughter. The Count promises to do wonders for the girl if the latter would arrange to have his daughter marry him. The Earl tries to force his daughter to marry the Count, but he was not the man of her heart, so she escaped to America. She considered the marriage vile, and would avoid it at any cost. She took with her a plotting Frenchman, who was known to her father. She was not aware of this at the time, so when she arrived in America, she decided to marry him. (He agreed to protect her with his name, nothing more.) She had arranged to marry Jean de Courtois to escape the Hungarian nobleman, disappear suddenly and later secure a divorce. De Courtois tries every method imaginable and every excuse ever invented to delay the wedding. He finally meets a newspaper reporter, whom he had met in America before, and gives him the whole story, but not his permission to use it. De Courtois promises he will give his consent in a day or so, and keeps the scribe waiting so long that he becomes disgusted. A few days later the scheming Hungarian gets in touch with a few questionable characters, who make their headquarters on the East Side in New York. He instructs them to watch de Courtois. Henry Hunter, the newspaper reporter in mention, insisted that de Courtois allow the wedding to take place immediately, but the latter complained of having lost the license. The Count's men have learned of this through their leader, Antoine. They also were aware of the fact that Hunter was to get another. John Delancey Curtis, with his friend, Howard Devar, arriving from China, register at the Central Hotel, and, unknowingly, secures a room quite near that occupied by de Courtois. That night the Count is overpowered by the Hungarian's paid men, bound and gagged to await the arrival of the newspaper reporter. Hunter arrives and just as he steps from the taxicab, is killed. Curtis is the only eyewitness. The police demand that he hold himself ready for the inquest in the morning. Late that night, while strolling up Broadway, Curtis discovers that he is wearing the coat of the murdered man. In the pocket he discovers a marriage license, made out to Lady Hermione and Jean de Courtois. This thrills Curtis, and he decides to see Lady Hermione and find out just what the license means. He arrives at her quarters and is informed that the man to whom she was to be married was nothing to her, except as a protector from the Hungarian. Curtis believed that de Courtois had been killed. He was not aware of the fad that the newspaper reporter had been sent for the license, and now Lady Hermione believes what Curtis had told her. Curtis offers himself as a bodyguard, and she accepts him, marrying him a few minute later. The Earl arrives in New York, is informed of the whereabouts of his daughter, and rushes to the minister's home, only to discover that Lady Hermione is married. They try to interfere with Curtis, but the young American, filled with spirit and enthusiasm, punches the Count in the eye, scaring the Earl almost out of his wits. Curtis and his bride catch a taxicab and leave the infuriated nobleman bewildered. They secure a suite at the Hotel Plaza. When the American returns to his room at the Central Hotel he is met by the Earl and the Count, who furiously reprimand him. Steingall, chief of detectives, links Curtis with the murder of de Courtois. De Courtois is later discovered in the room almost exhausted. He refuses to talk. Steingall found telegrams from the Earl, asking to delay the ceremony until his arrival, and that he, de Courtois, would be paid well. Curtis manages to convince the detective that he is guiltless and later discovers the car in which the murderers had escaped. He follows the machine. With the aid of the detectives. Curtis and Devar capture the East Side assassins. The Earl endeavors to have Curtis arrested on the charge of abduction, but when Steingall makes it plain to the Count and Earl that they must leave this country immediately, or he will arrest them in connection with the murder of the reporter, they are glad to leave. The adventure brought about an undying friendship between Steingall. Curtis and Devar, and it is said by those who know that Curtis and Lady Hermione lived happily ever after. In fact, she did not remember that she had married him for a bodyguard, for she loved him with her whole heart and soul, and he worshiped the ground she walked on.",

Phillip, having quarreled with his step-father, leaves home, secures a position, and lives at the same boarding house as Hazel. Called home by his mother's sudden illness, Phillip manages to have Hazel called on the case. Her recognition of the doctor as the man whose trickery she discovered in time to save her own honor, is concealed from Phillip, but her stay is rendered almost unbearable by the doctor's forced attentions. Mrs. Morgan dies suddenly and in terrible agony, from arsenic poisoning. Suspicion points to Hazel, proof of her knowledge of the location of a bottle of arsenic being established by Morgan. Her former supposed relations with the doctor appear as a reason for the crime. Phillip's testimony is against her, but Gordon Graham, a wealthy young man who is on the jury, is at once impressed with the girl's innocence, and succeeds in securing a verdict of \"not guilty.\" Throughout the trail the spirit of the poisoned woman endeavors to point out the guilty person. The weight of public opinion, however, falls heavily upon the girl, sensational newspapers doing their share to increase it, until Hazel can find no place to stay. Finally Graham takes her to his sister's home where he declares his love for Hazel and an unshaken belief in her innocence. Smith, a dope fiend, refused drugs by Dr. Morgan, threateningly reveals his knowledge that the doctor has substituted arsenic for powders prescribed for his wife by the attending physician. During the struggle which follows, Hazel, Graham and a policeman appear, and Smith, having secured possession of the doctor's pistol, fires the shot which mortally wounds Dr. Morgan, who confesses in his dying moments that he is the guilty person. Hazel's innocence is thus established, the public opinion is quickly changed, and the girl goes to the waiting arms of the man who has so valiantly defended her.",

How Steve Collins was given his huge opportunity after Belfast fighter Ray Close had to stand down when a routine scan showed lesions on his brain. And Eubank's career had been touched by controversy, including the life-changing injuries sustained by Michael Watson in their fight just four years earlier.",

    "description": "A row of very unsanitary tenements in the New York slums are owned by Mrs. Burke-Smith, an utterly selfish woman who belongs to clubs for moral uplift, but will not practice any practical charity. Her daughter Alice, on the contrary, is genuinely interested in settlement work and devotes most of her time to it. She is assisted by poor but promising young physician Dr. Taylor, who is in love with her and whom she loves. Through their efforts to help a consumptive child, Alice and Dr. Taylor become acquainted with Maggie Schultz and her husband Heine. Though they live in one of the Burke-Smith tenements they keep their two rooms clean. The wife is sweet and the husband is hard-working and honest. Maggie, who expects a child in the near future, is afraid to confess this fact to Heine, because he holds the theory that it is wrong to bring little ones into the world under the conditions to which they are subject. Over Maggie lives an Irish woman by the name of Bates, who, when her husband was alive, lived in the open, wind-swept spaces of the West and has never forgotten it. She has a good-for-nothing son, Steve, a second-story man under the eye of a detective by the name of Rafferty. From Bates, Maggie learns that for the sum of only $100 she could go West with her husband and establish a homestead on the government plan. Alice induces her mother to visit the tenements from which she gets her rent and Mrs. Burke-Smith offers Maggie $5 a week to work in her house. This $5 is very much needed, because Heine is out of work through a strike, and Maggie finally accepts the position. She does not definitely decide this, however, until Steve, the second-story man, has offered her the money to go West if she will help him rob the Burke-Smith house. He tries to excuse his plan to Maggie on the ground that Mrs. Burke-Smith is the owner of their wretched tenement, and Maggie, who is frantic because of the secret she dares not reveal, feels that to get the money in this way would only be doing justice to herself and her unborn child. True to her arrangement with Steve, Maggie helps him rob the Burke-Smith house, and receives as her reward a diamond brooch belonging to Alice, which she pawns for $113. Rafferty, the detective, is quickly suspicious and soon forces Maggie into such a position that she confesses to her husband. When Heine learns what his wife has done, and why she did it, he gives evidence of the finest manhood by standing by her and trying to accept absolutely all the responsibility and blame. Alice, whose kindness for Maggie is unremitting, foils the detective by insisting that she has lent the money to Maggie, and at the same time, getting back her brooch from the place where Maggie has pawned it. There is a final big scene in which Maggie denounces the conditions under which she dwells, and Mrs. Burke-Smith is ultimately touched so that she begins to appreciate how wicked she has been. The play comes to a happy conclusion, with Maggie and Heine planning to begin their Western trip at once.",

    "description": "The Grant and Morey families have been enemies for generations. Beth Grant and Jack Morey marry secretly, and when the expected result of marriage is near at hand, decide to leave home rather than betray their secret. Virginia Grant overhears their plans to leave and, thinking that Morey has dishonored her sister, tells Harry Grant, who proclaims vengeance upon Morey. Rich planter Silas Lacey asks Harry Grant's consent to marry his sister Virginia Lacey, not being of the proper social strata. Grant is indignant in his refusal and throws Lacey bodily from the house. Lacey kills Grant, but everybody suspects Jack Morey, who fled when his secret wife died birthing a child. Only Lacey's old slave Jeff knows that Lacey is Harry Grant's murderer. Virginia, believing that Beth's child is illegitimate. conceals the fact of its birth and leaves it on Jeff's doorstep. Inside Jeff's cabin at the time is Jeff's daughter Cora, safe from the bloodhounds that have been trailing her, but deathly ill from childbirth. When Jeff finds the baby on his doorstep, he believes it's his granddaughter and rears her as Linda. Fifteen years later, Hugh Morey lays siege to Virginia's hand but she won't marry him because she believes that Jack Morey killed her brother Harry. Lacey is also a persistent suitor, but Virginia disdains him because she really loves Hugh Morey despite the family feud. Virginia's greatest murder is the secret knowledge that Linda, whom Jeff is raising as his granddaughter, is actually her own niece, the daughter of her dead sister Beth. Lacey claims possession of Linda, thinking she's the offspring of one of his slaves. Lacey's son Harvey covets Linda. To old Lacey, however, Linda is valuable. Virginia's care of her at Jeff's and her great interest in the welfare of the supposed slave-child gives him a strong influence to bear upon his suit for Virginia's hand. Finally Virginia consents to marry Lacey if he will free Linda. Harvey Lacey hears of the bargain and while old Lacey is \"waiting at the church,\" kidnaps Linda and takes her aboard a river boat. By the coincidence of moving-picture license, Jack Morey, who has never been heard from since he left home following Harry Grant's murder, is traveling on the same steamer. Seeing Linda carried on board the boat and locked in one of the cabins, Jack Morey rescues her in the nick of time. Complications are soon set right. The ending of the story is the wedding of Hugh Morey and the proof, through Jeff's disclosure, that Lacey was the murderer of Harry Grant.",

One particular student, Sumadya, stands out due to her exceptional ability to achieve a deep hypnotic trance that transcends space and time during Warenya's mental exercises. During one such hypnotic session, Sumadya becomes a conduit for Rajini, a renowned actress from the past who lived five decades ago. This extraordinary connection allows Rajini to communicate with Warenya, who resides in the year 2020, from her living self in the 1960s. Rajini seizes this opportunity to learn professional acting from Warenya. However, despite her successful acting career, she yearns for intimacy and love, finding solace in her connection with Warenya across time. As their affection deepens, complications arise as the love between Warenya and Rajini relies on Sumadya remaining a conduit. The revelation of this requirement adds complexity to the situation and poses challenges for all involved. Warenya realizes that their true enemy is not fate but the intangible and inexorable force known as time. With this understanding, the lovers must come to terms with their separate lives and distinct temporal realities. Ultimately, Warenya and Rajini make the difficult decision to walk away from their passionate connection, understanding that their love can only exist in the unique space created by Sumadya's presence. They must embrace the limitations imposed by time, accepting that their lives must continue in their respective eras.",

The presented version of events was not possible to present during the Polish People's Republic (PRL), i.e. in the years 1944-1989. The main character is interrogated and tortured in the prison on Rakowiecka Street in Warsaw by officers of the Security Office of the Polish People's Republic. During the interrogation, the captain talks about his activities during World War II, an important topic is his stay in the Konzentrationslager Auschwitz concentration camp. The film shows the situation during the war and after the official end of World War II in 1945. After 1945, Poland was a Soviet dictatorship. People like Witold Pilecki, who was a hero fighting for Poland's freedom (dangerous to the USSR dictatorship), should have been defamed and murdered according to the law. Comrade Cyrankiewicz and other comrades from Moscow could not let public opinion that Pilecki was, among others, organizer of the resistance movement in KL Auschwitz. The film shows that, according to the official, only correct opinion of the communist party, Comrade Cyrankiewicz led the resistance movement in the Nazi death camp. After torture and a scheduled trial, the hero is sentenced to death. He was murdered in 25 May 1948. The film shows, among other things, KL Auschwitz through the eyes of a Polish prisoner, an officer. The Warsaw Uprising, the security torture chambers.",

When Perry's fiancée Camilla mistakes criminal Slim Attucks for Perry, Attucks realizes that he can take advantage of the resemblance and concocts an elaborate plan, installing his cohorts in positions close to the Dantons. He then has Perry shanghaied onto a steamer bound for Honolulu. Taking over Perry's job and fiancée, Attucks soon becomes so familiar with Perry's affairs that Perry can make no one believe his story when he returns. After enlisting the aid of the editor of a major newspaper, Perry confronts his double in the lawyer's office, where a test is administered that supports Attucks' claim, thanks to Perry's feeble knowledge of his own affairs. Perry is spotted by a banker whom Attucks had previously robbed and is subsequently arrested, but a reporter who believes Perry's story arranges for his release and for yet another confrontation, this time in Perry's home. All the evidence points against Perry until his dog recognizes his true master, exposing Attucks' charade. Camilla tells Perry that she has known of the deception for some time, but that she would not speak up until Perry had proved true to the Danton motto: \"Always Audacious.\"",

She plants seeds of jealousy within the wife by telling her the physician loves his adopted child, whom he has brought up from infancy. The wife flies in a rage, charging her husband with infidelity; whereupon the widow, making her revenge complete, reads a diary to husband and wife foolishly kept by the artist, telling of his relations with the former secretary.

They knew that the penalty for disobeying the law was to cut off the ears of the offender, so great consternation seized them when the sheriff and his men came to arrest Robin, and not being admitted, they fired their arrows into the court, one of which struck Marian's father dead. The sheriff and his men retreated, only to return reinforced by more soldiers, and a bitter hand-to-hand struggle took place on the drawbridge, the women having reached the forest by a secret underground passage. They were later joined by Robin and his men, who after Robin and Marian had been married by the friar, pronounced them king and queen. They took oath to punish the rich and cruel, but aid the poor and oppressed. Alan-a-Dale appears on the scene, and is made a captive, but after he tells his story, they agree to help him. He seeks the hand of a young lady whose miserly father wants her to marry a decrepit old nobleman, who promises her parent money if she will marry him. Marian disguises herself as a gypsy and visits the girl to assure her that Robin and his men will aid her at the critical moment. They are ready, and when the Saxon maiden is standing before the bishop, who is about to pronounce her the wife of the nobleman, Robin Hood and his men pour in through windows and doors, and Friar Tuck places her hand in Alan-a-Dale's and pronounces them man and wife, whereupon they all return to the forest, where they are free from molestation. On one occasion the sheriff arranged for an archery contest, open to all comers. Robin appears in disguise, and wins the prize. The King disguised as a mendicant, is shown such consideration by Robin and his men, that he returns to the palace and pardons them for all past offenses.",

Packing young Creighton off to a boarding school, Needham takes possession of the Creighton estate and begins a life of riotous dissipation. Several years elapse, until one morning Needham receives a letter from America stating that young Creighton is coming home to demand possession of his estate and will require an accounting for every penny. Joseph Norbury lives in a quiet English village and reads the news that Needham has been appointed executor of the Creighton estate. Norbury's wife remarks that with his mustache off. Norbury could easily be taken for Needham. In after years Norbury moves to London, where he and Needham met at the same club and become fast friends. When Needham learns that he is to be called to account for his stewardship, he realizes that imprisonment faces him and to avoid disgrace, he undertakes to devise measures to commit murder. Having sent to the Creighton country seat the servants from the Creighton townhouse, he invites Norbury to visit him. During the evening, Needham contrives to drop poison into the wine which Norbury drinks and after Norbury falls dead upon the floor, Needham changes clothes with the corpse. The murderer then goes to Norbury's home and undertakes to pass himself off as Norbury. The papers next morning relate how John Needham has been found a suicide in the Creighton mansion. Upon discovery of the corpse, Parks, who has been Needham's valet, refuses to believe that the dead man was his master, and through this suspicion and some good detective work by Parks, Needham is subsequently accused of the crime. Taking advantage of momentary opportunity, Needham drinks some of the same poison which he had given to Norbury and dies.",

    "description": "Guido Capanelli is an adventurer, his good looks and courtly bearing helping him through many successes. He has gained entrance to the best society, incidentally making the acquaintance of Princess Dione, whose father. Prince Paul Ragosin, is in feeble health. Prince Ragosin has expressed a wish that Princess Dione shall marry Feodor Strogoff, and on his death bed gains the promise from Dione that his wish shall be gratified. Feodor allows Guido Capanelli to be Dione's greatest source of sympathy in the hours of her grief, and in consequence, Guido so ingratiates himself with the Princess that she marries the adventurer, regardless of her pledge. Previous to Prince Ragosin's death Dione became interested in Katerina Vlasoff, a girl who is a street vendor of crude images and daughter of Peter Vlasoff, a drunken beast. When the girl returns home one evening without having made a sale all day Vlasoff sends her into the streets, threatening her with harm if she does not return with money to buy him wine. Katerina is accosted by Guido Capanelli, and; submits to his advances that she may have money to take home. She is so humiliated that she is glad to take her brother's advice to visit Princess Dione, the friend of everybody who is poor and in distress. Touched by Katerina's story, Princess Dione sends the girl to a convent, having gained Prince Paul Ragosin's consent to thus befriend the outcast. After Dione and Guido are married, Katerina returns from, the convent to make her home with her benefactress. Guido, under threat of exposing Katerina, demands a renewal of their relations and the deceitful couple start at once to plot against Princess Dione. When the Princess falls ill, they appoint themselves her nurses and in neglecting to administer medicines properly create a comatose condition that closely resembles death. The Princess is buried and Guido and Katerina establish themselves in control of her lands and fortune. When Dione had married Guido she received a book from Feodor Strogoff with an inscription in effect that he would always stand ready to befriend the woman he loved, but had discarded Slim for another. After the Princess is entombed, Feodor visits the sepulcher and discovers that Dione is alive, having simply been in a trance. Convinced, by what she herself witnessed of the treachery of her husband and Katerina, the Princess goes with Feodor to Rome, for the purpose of biding their time for vengeance. Guido and Katerina visit Rome and Guido becomes enamored of a famous beauty who has become the toast of the town. The woman is slow to accept Guido's advances, but finally tells him that a famous ring that has been buried with the Princess Dione will be the price of her affection. When Guido returns to the sepulcher to rob his wife's corpse, he finds the coffin empty. As he turns away from the tomb, he sees what he believes to be the ghost of the Princess. The apparition drives him insane and he runs to a nearby cliff and throws himself into the ocean. Katerina returns to the street from whence she came and Princess Dione and Feodor find happiness in marriage.",

    "description": "John Cranford, a secret agent of the United States Customs service, has succeeded in unearthing a gigantic smuggling plot. The operations of the smugglers range from contraband opium to diamonds. Opium is found and confiscated, and burned in the street as a warning against future law-breaking. The men who have been handling it are apprehended, but the \"man higher up\" remains shrouded in mystery, free to pursue his schemes, and it becomes the purpose of Cranford's life to bring him to justice. To recuperate before entering upon his pursuit, John goes to the St. Lawrence River for a fishing trip. Expecting to hire his old friend and guide, \"Uncle Billy,\" he is greatly disappointed at finding that worthy man's time engaged by a charming, mysterious young woman, who insists on fishing in the neighborhood of Pidgin Island. Diana Wynne, the girl in question, comes to Billy's boathouse while John is there, and Billy introduces them. They meet often, and John finds himself falling in love with Diana, but his curiosity is aroused by the air of mystery surrounding her, and he cannot understand her strange interest in the launches plying around the island. To this region comes \"the man higher up,\" Michael Smead, his son Donald and two accomplices, to operate a great smuggling deal on the Canadian border. John recognizes Smead, having previously blocked him in an attempt to smuggle many thousands of dollars' worth of diamonds. Donald is a stranger to him, for he is new to the game. John, finding that his \"vacation\" has furnished him with the biggest job of his life, watches Smead closely. Complications arise from the fact that Diana also is a secret service agent, and she too is watching Smead's hand. In so doing her actions arouse John's suspicion that she is in league with the band, and the two agents suspect each other. One stormy evening Diana intercepts a telegram to Smead which reads: \"Pidgin tonight at 8 without fail.\" She hastens to Uncle Billy, asking him to take her over to the island at once. They set out in the storm, much against the wishes of \"Mr. Billy.\" John, coming directly afterwards, is told of their destination, and fearing for Diana's safety in the gathering storm forces young Lester, a guide, to take him in pursuit. The storm rages in fury about both boats, and the waves run high. Smead's Canadian agents are in an aeroplane coming toward Pidgin. They are smuggling the gems, which are concealed in the hollow butts of two fishing poles, but the aeroplane is lost in the storm near Pidgin Lighthouse. Billy's boat is dashed to pieces on the reef and Billy and Diana are thrown into the water. They manage to reach an isolated rock, wreckage-washed, to which they cling in momentary fear of being washed shorewards, where the waves are smashing against the reef. Finally Diana is swept from the rock, and Cranford swims to her assistance. Lester, after a struggle, rescues Uncle Billy, and the keeper of the light on Pidgin Reef gives them all a shelter. Next morning Cranford finds the Smead telegram in Diana's coat pocket, and with it a letter from the customs department establishing her identity. Diana surprises him going through her effects, but he convinces her that he too is a government agent. Uncle Billy finds the fishing rods on the island and brings them to the lighthouse, where Cranford discovers their contents to be a fortune in pearls. He hastens to the village and arrests Smead, Donald and their accomplices almost before they know they are suspected. When John proposes to Diana she refuses him, telling him she is the daughter of a criminal and the sister of a criminal. Smead is her father, and she has engaged in the service and come to Pidgin to try to prevent her brother from engaging in his father's scheme. But John Cranford refuses to take \"No\" as an answer, and the sincerity of his wooing wins him Diana's consent to become his wife.",

The Viceroy decided to plant a Spanish colony and dispatched a column of settlers under the command of Juan Batista Anza, and Padre Junipero Serra, a monk, to the newly-found country. After a hazardous journey the colonists arrived, and the pious monk, raising the banners of the church and of Spain aloft, invoked the blessing of the Almighty upon the settlement named in honor of St. Francis. A hundred years passed over the little town before the first Yankee arrived from the distant United States, a thousand miles to the eastward. In him was the spirit of California's future greatness, for, from that moment, dates the periods of great expansion and prosperity which has made California one of the greatest States in the Union. Shortly after this the Mexican war was fought, and California became a territory of the United States. In 1849 gold was accidentally discovered near the then-village of San Francisco. From all parts of the world throngs of adventurers flocked to California. So great was the development that before another year had passed California was admitted as a full-fledged member into the Sisterhood of States. The next decade saw the rapidly-growing city in the clutches of a ring of lawless politicians. We next see the fair city of St. Francis almost leveled to the ground as the result of the great earthquake. Vast stretches that had been reduced to charred ruins are shown upon the screen. In the rebuilding of the almost-destroyed city we see the indomitable American spirit that has made the United States one of the leaders among nations assert itself. Undaunted by disaster, faithful to its ideals the newer and greater city of St. Francis arises from the smoldering ashes of her former self. A beautiful panoramic view showing the entire great Panama-Pacific Exposition, with the hills of the Golden Gate sloping to the sea, brings the spectacle to a fitting conclusion.",

    "description": "Though the weather outside was miserable, it had no effect upon the members within the pleasant room of the Astor Club. To pass the time merrily, a game of cards was proposed, and Lord Lister, a detective, arose from the table a lucky winner. Being naturally a close observer, his eyes fell upon an inscription on one of the dollar bills, \"We are held prisoners by a Chinese gang at Cosia, near Sacramento. Send help.\" After discussing this appeal among his friends, he is determined to unravel the mystery and his friend, Charles Brand, consents to accompany him. On a vast farm in the small village of Cosia lives Mr. Wu Chung Foo, a rich Chinese merchant, of whom Lord Lister has often heard his friend, Gov. Morton, speak. Through him he secures a letter of introduction to the merchant, asking him to permit two close friends to have the use of his hunting grounds. The next day Lister and Brand start out on their journey, well prepared for all contingencies. At their destination they are met by Mr. Wu Chung Foo and escorted to his home. On the way Wu Chung, trying to make his guests uncomfortable, explains that his ground is the exact location where so many people have mysteriously disappeared. This does not set fear in Lord Lister but a firm resolve to carry out his plans. A peculiar stare in the eyes of the yellow man gives Lord Lister grounds for suspicion. At his home they are introduced to his adopted daughter Hattie, and not many words had passed between them before she cultivates a strong liking for Charles Brand. Wu Chung suspects that the purpose of their visit is to gain his secret. Not approving of their purpose, and of the friendship which has sprung up between Hattie and Charles, Wu Chung informs the agent of his subterranean city to capture the latter, and to set him to work in the mine as a slave. That night the detective decides to go one step further into the mystery and, disguising himself as a shadow, he ventures into the private room of the master of the house. Here he learns of the secret door built in one of the walls which leads to the solution of the enigma. As Wu Chung passes in, Lister follows, but his steps are halted by an iron gate to which he has no key. The next day while out riding, Hattie and Lister discover that Charles, who had ridden ahead, has mysteriously disappeared from his horse. To lessen the grief of Hattie, Lister acquaints her with the circumstances of which she had not the slightest knowledge. When the matter is explained to Wu Chung, he catches the accusing eye of Lister and decides to rid himself of his second burden. In a like manner as his friend, the detective is seized by an ape and carried into a cave through rocks. Horrified at her second discovery, Hattie determines to master the situation. She obtains possession of the key, and, with gun in hand, gains entrance to the subterranean city, where many white men are held as slaves and worked to death in her foster father's mine. Having presence of mind, she runs for the help of the soldiers. They arrive in time, capturing the criminals, and giving Wu Chung the just measures he deserves. Hattie is once more safe in the arms of her lover and the white men are freed, while Lord Lister, their liberator, having accomplished his purpose, happily looks on.",

Green, a member of the club, lives in the apartment beneath that of William Wright, a broker. Wright is in business difficulties, but his business associates have not yet learned this, as his wife's father has promised to relieve the situation with a loan. Daisy Dean, Wright's stenographer, is in his confidence. Daisy has her foot caught in the elevator of the building and Mr. Wright takes her home in his car. As he passes the club window, the gossips and Green see him with Daisy and slander is started. Green, coming home, tells his wife of Wright's joy ride with his office girl. Their servant overhears and quickly calls the news up the dumbwaiter to Mrs. Wright's maid in the flat above. Mrs. Wright enters in time to hear the discussion and her slumbering jealousy is fanned into a flame. In Daisy's neighborhood her ride in Mr. Wright's car has occasioned some comment, especially from Susan, an old maid aunt next door, whose brother, Robert, has long loved Daisy in secret. Daisy is engaged to Austin Clark. Mrs. Wright has particularly noted that the stenographer always has a bunch of daisies on her desk. In the most innocent fashion, Mr. Wright comes home with one of the flowers in his button-hole. The fact that Daisy is seen morning and evening in Mr. Wright's car gives color to the lies that are now freely circulating. Daisy and Austin quarrel and part. Mrs. Wright haunts Daisy's neighborhood in a taxicab and has her worse suspicions confirmed in the fact that her husband is seen outside. Without giving him a chance, she leaves him. The father withdraws his financial support and ruin overtakes Wright. One morning the newspaper has an item which reads: \"Wife of broker leaves him on eve of his bankruptcy. Mrs. William Wright returns to her father's house. She will apply for divorce from her husband, naming his stenographer. Daisy Dean, as co-respondent.\" By the time the gossips get through with Daisy Dean, she is glad to marry Robert, next door, for protection. On the day of her wedding. Austin repents his hastiness and writes that he has never ceased to love her, but it is too late and Daisy hides the letter with his photograph. Wright, broken and penniless, is saved from suicide by his old mother. Time passes and the old trouble seems forgotten. In their new happiness, Daisy and Robert and their baby go to a seaside town for the summer. Robert's work calls him away and his sister, Susan, in spite of her dislike of Daisy, comes to stay with her during his absence. In the meantime, Austin, who is now engaged to a girl in the town, comes down for his vacation. He and Daisy meet and he introduces the two women. Daisy remembers his photograph and letter hidden away; gets them out and burns them, but Susan recovers the end of the letter, which was burned and which reads: \"I have never ceased to love you. Austin.\" She sends the letter to her brother. Daisy is included in many of their engagement festivities in a perfectly innocent way, but to Susan's suspicious mind there can only be one conclusion placed upon their intimacy. The letters and insinuations to Robert breathe such suspicion against Daisy and Austin that he is driven almost mad. Finally, unable to work, he returns home without notifying his wife. The same evening, Daisy has joined Austin and a party of their friends in an auto ride out of town for dinner. A series of accidents to the car, miles from nowhere, detain them until dawn. A cottager, who proves to be Mr. Wright, assists them. Robert reaches his home about daylight in a condition bordering on insanity. He is met by Susan with the news that Daisy has been out all night with Austin. The auto party, having stopped at the sweetheart's home, drops her and her parents first and Austin then escorts Daisy to her cottage. On entering the house, Daisy is confronted by Robert and Susan. A terrible scene takes place, during which Robert's self-control is entirely lost. Austin, returning from the garage, passes the house and is shot dead by Robert, who is taken into custody. Daisy, terror-stricken, takes her baby and hastens as far from the town as her strength will carry her. At last, more dead than alive, she sees no hope for herself but death and is about to end her life and the baby's when she is saved by Mr. Wright, who takes her to his mother. The shock of the tragedy kills Robert's sister, while Daisy receives the following letter: \"Do not come home, I am disgraced enough. Your Mother.\" News reaches the clubroom that Mr. Wright and Daisy Dean are living in the same house and the scandal goes on.",

In addition to that, all the relatives are surprised that the foster son of Christine apparently maintained a correspondence with Christine. Nevertheless, Christine's last wish is respected, and they decided to bury her in Wentelen, and wish to do so traditionally, meaning: walking behind the hearse. During a walk of several days, all the relatives (foster sisters, foster father, alleged friends and real ones, the foster son, lovers) have enough time to get to know each other better. Because in the end they have no other conclusion than that nobody really knew anyone. Old intrigues are dug up, the foster sisters finally learn why the foster brother just disappeared from the family, and they can begin to develop a real image of the mother. Once Christine's final resting place is reached and she is buried, all family ties, good and bad, are shaken around.",

    "description": "Rev. Dr. Penfield Sturgis, of fashionable St. Martins-in-the-Lane, finds himself face to face with Jane Bartlett, a grand opera prima donna whose opera he has denounced on grounds of morality, and who comes to his very vestry room to make him \"eat his sermon word for word.\" Out of the encounter a strange acquaintance develops, Jane Bartlett interested through vindictive reasons, the rector through the challenge to his church. She prevails upon him to visit the notorious opera, which but deepens his previous convictions, but meanwhile he discovers a surprising humanity in the woman herself. Just as it is beginning to dawn upon him that maybe he takes himself a shade too seriously, word comes that the Mayor has closed \"Zaporah\" on the strength of his own condemnatory sermon. Repentant, Sturgis decides to apologize in an open letter to the newspapers, at which his vestry and congregation, already perturbed by the ascendancy of the Bartlett woman, are up in arms. To preserve her dignity the young rector offers to marry her, and she accepts him, thus at last making him \"eat his sermon word for word,\" as she had set out to do. But her vanity appeased, Jane Bartlett proceeds to make peace between her young rector and Georgine Darigal, daughter of the rector emeritus and formerly his fiancée, and the reconciliation assured, Jane Bartlett gracefully withdraws.",

    "description": "News is received by Sir Jeoffrey, a dissolute roué, whose contempt for the other sex extends even to his own daughters, of the arrival of another female child in the family. The mother dies shortly after, and the child, Clorinda, is brought up among the servants without a guiding hand. True to his vow to ignore his offspring, Sir Jeoffrey does not come in contact with Clo, until her sixth year, when he finds her playing with his powder horn in the great hall of his castle, Wildair, and sternly upbraids her. The child, who has inherited her father's courage and strength of will, shows no fear, and grasping a riding crop beats Sir Jeoffrey with all the fury of her tiny wrath. Her spirit and daring attract Sir Jeoffrey's attention, and he is delighted to find the child his own. From that moment, he keeps her in his own company, dressed in boy's clothing to obscure her sex, a member of his wanton circle. She grows up in this atmosphere of debauchery, and learns to swear, smoke and drink. Years later, at a hunting lodge, she meets the Duke of Osmonde and other great gentlemen, who are shocked at her male attire and masculine manners. In a spirit of pious benevolence, Lord Twenlow sends his chaplain to Wildair Hall to censure Sir Jeoffrey for permitting his daughter to grow up in this wild style. Clo overhears the Chaplain's remonstrances and realizes the true significance of her reckless habits. Meantime, her notoriety has reached London, and Sir John Oxon, the beau ideal of the town, lays a wager that he will win the heart of Clo, not as a hoyden, but as a woman. He arrives at Wildair Hall on Clo's birthday-night, and banters her on her claims to masculine prowess. Stung by his derision to prove she has all the attributes of a man, she challenges him to a duel, in which Sir John Oxon is badly worsted. However, his sarcasm has had definite effect and at the striking of the midnight hour, she gives the toast to the assembled noblemen: \"Behold me for the last time clad in trousers.\" Later she appears in the Hall dressed in all the finery of a lady of quality, and from that moment bends every effort to attain that title legitimately. Sir John Oxon piles all his wiles to win her untutored heart, and she finally falls a victim to his flattery. Secretly she meets him in the rose garden, but publicly she slights him in the great halls. Nevertheless, Oxon wins her confidence, and she bestows her first kiss upon his lips, but not without a price, for at that moment he steals one of her raven curls, the proof of his wager. He hastens back to London to boast of his conquest, but in an intoxicated moment he hides the curl for safe-keeping, forgetting where. Clo waits for his return and is shocked when she receives news from London that he is to wed a wealthy lady of title. At this critical moment in her life the old Earl of Dunstanwolde asks her hand in marriage, and piqued at having thrown her affections so idly away, she accepts. A half hour later, she meets the Duke of Osmonde, and recognizes in him the man she loves. Faithful to her promise, she marries the Earl of Dunstanwolde, and becomes his devoted wife until he dies two years later. Sir John Oxon, having failed to make his match, and aware that Clo now possesses wealth, influence and position, tries to win back the heart he had so ruthlessly cast aside. But Osmonde has triumphed over her affections, causing jealousy and hatred to creep into the heart of Oxon. Chance places again in his hand the lost curl, which he holds over her head as a silken sword. Stunned by the fear that she will lose the love of Osmonde through the accusing evidence of the curl in an intensely dramatic scene in which Oxon attempts to force his embraces upon her, she strikes him across the temple with her riding crop. He falls to the floor. She lashes him, the pale still body lies there, dead. At that moment guests arrive, she conceals the body under the couch, and in the dead of night she drags it down into the deep cellar. For years afterwards, she atones for her sin by paying Oxon's debts, consoling the women had he wronged, and in other ways undoing the evil he had wrought.",

    "description": "Arthur Stillman, the senior member of the firm of Stillman and Thornton, cotton goods manufacturers of Rockton, Mass., has closed his mills under the pretense that he cannot obtain cotton to operate, but really because he has conceived the plan of secretly buying cotton and storing it for the rise in price that he knows will come. The town of Rockton is entirely dependent upon the mills for its existence and the closing of the mills causes great suffering and even starvation. Dell Hamilton, daughter of an old mill dyer and a favorite with her people by reason of her sweet character and true sympathy with them, is probably the one in Rockton who suffers most. Her lover, Sam Lloyd, in despair at his inability to provide for his mother and sick sister, receives a note from a friend suggesting that if he can get to Springdale, a town nine miles distant, that he may get a job as fireman in a certain mill. On his way home, he accidentally comes upon a large warehouse which he learns is filled with cotton bales, and upon careful inquiry he finds that the cotton is being stored there by Stillman and Thornton. In a flash the true state of affairs is recognized by him and spurred on by bitter anger he makes his way back to Rockton, where he meets some of his mates and makes known his discovery. The news spreads throughout the town and groups of mill hands gather here and there voicing their indignation. Bill Slinger, a great strapping big-hearted fellow and a favorite among them is selected as a leader to get them either justice or revenge. Dell, in horror, goes to Stillman's house to warn him of his danger. She pleads with Stillman to open the mills and give work to the people and tries to soften his heart with her stories of the condition of the people. Stillman, whose passion for the girl has been growing stronger day by day, finally tells her that he will open the mills upon one condition, that is that she marry him. Stillman hastily arranges an illegal marriage with Dell. The girl believes she is to become his lawful wife, but Stillman has no such intention. The ceremony is performed and they repair to Stillman's home in the country. Dell writes her father of her marriage to Stillman, but he intercepts the letter and substitutes one supposed to come from a certain friend saying that Dell will not be home that night because she is going to watch by the body of the dead boy, Bennie. In the meantime Stillman's love for the girl is growing genuine and she becomes the one thing in the world that he desires and his one fear is that she may learn the secret of the illegal life. Dell returns to the mill and is indignantly repulsed by her former friends. Her father in a bitter scene renounces her and in utter dejection she finds her way to the boiler room of the mill seeking Sam, from whom she at least expects sympathy. She meets with the same treatment at Sam's hands and in fact is informed by this that he has entirely forgotten her and is to be married to another. Dell has heard the conversation between Stillman and Sam and a revelation comes to her. She realizes the true condition. She knows that Stillman is the real love and slowly and sadly she walks to him as she asks him to take her back.",

Before he goes, his father promises to live honestly, but two years later he dies without confessing his true character. Some years later Dick is released from prison on good behavior. In vain he searches for some trace of his family. Employers are wary of hiring a jailbird. Doris lives with her Uncle Jake, who makes her steal for a living and beats her when the returns are not large enough. At last Doris can stand it no longer and decides to run away. But the dreary streets are the only paths open to her and in despair she too, resorts to the river. She is prevented from committing suicide by Dick, who has come there for the same purpose. Their common plight forms a tie for a strong friendship and they decide to help each other. However, the task is too much and they are at last destitute. Each fights his own battle. Doris is tempted to steal again, and Dick is sorely tempted to leave the straight path he has cut out for himself so as not to starve. One day Doris rescues a child from a burning house, and as a reward is given a position as nurse. Dick meanwhile determines that he will steal rather than see Doris starve. But being a novice he is easily detected by the man whose pocket he tries to pick. Dick pleads with him and the man finally consents to give him a position in his office. Later a detective calls and tells the man, Graham, that Dick is an ex-convict. Graham is glad to hear this, as he himself is a crook, which gives him a hold over Dick.

    "description": "The Sardou play begins with this girl's life as the young wife of a man nearing forty, kind enough to his bride, but more or less absorbed in his serious work. She has dreamed of romantic love, intoxicating adventure, and tumultuous passions only to find none of these things in retirement with a good husband. She decided that her existence has been wrecked and ruined, and gets it into her foolish head that the only remedy is a divorce. There is a lover handy, her husband's cousin Adhemar, French in his ambition to have an \"affair\" with some charming married woman, and equally French in his thrift; he is a poor young man in no situation to marry any such extravagant young lady. The clear-headed husband enters into a little conspiracy with some friends to let his bored young wife have her own way, ostensibly yielding to her wishes, and he even makes things as easy and comfortable as possible for the unsuspecting lover, inviting him to the house, and announcing that he has even provided for his wife's future by settling a large sum of money upon her. She sees that this settlement has weight with the lover, and begins to falter, but she goes on determinedly with what gradually loses all the charm of forbidden fruit. Her relations with Adhemar become more and more commonplace at a time when she begins to realize her husband's magnanimity. He has denied her nothing, and he gives Adhemar full permission to marry her as soon as the divorce is granted. Meanwhile she begins to be distressed by the fact that her husband seems to be enjoying himself, staying out late at night, and suspects that he has an \"affair\" with some woman \"not worthy\" of him. She revolts when he announces he has a dinner engagement, urges him to break it and have a little celebration with her and Adhemar, finally deciding to leave Adhemar out altogether. It would be such a lark to steal away from him and have dinner in a private room with her husband, so compromising. Adhemar learns of the infidelity of his wife-to-be, and goes in search of her in a rainstorm. He is drenched when he finds the restaurant where she is dining alone with her husband in a private room contrary to what he conceives to be the rights of a husband-to-be, and he is so indignant that he seeks the protection of a Commissary of police as a safeguard for his future marital rights. The situation now becomes ludicrous in the extreme, and it ends with restored sanity for the young wife, and a complete reconciliation with her husband.",

The girl loves frivolous things and Bancroft, a divinity student, finally estranges himself from her by his continual efforts to preach to her. Attracted by Hugh Wiley, a gambler, from a nearby city, Naomi finally elopes with him and eventually becomes known as the gambling queen. The girl's one ambition in life is to hoard up her wealth against the day when she shall lose her beauty and her popularity. Bancroft has plunged into religious work. He has become famous as an evangelist and has been trusted with the combination to the vault of the great tabernacle over which he presides. Learning this fact, Wiley inflames the mind of Naomi against Bancroft on the false ground that he has spurned her because of her life. He plans to have Naomi lure Bancroft to her gambling palace on a pretense, to overpower the minister while he is in there, steal the combination and loot the tabernacle. Furthermore, Wiley arranges to have the executive board of the tabernacle informed when the minister is in the gambling den, and to have the place raided by the police while he and his pal, McCarthy, rob the tabernacle. But the minister is too strong to succumb to the temptations of Naomi when he reaches her apartment, and his spiritual power wins the repentance of his temptress. Wiley, realizing that he is losing, springs upon Bancroft from behind and gets the combination away from him while his confederate alarms the police and the executive board according to the plan. But Naomi spirits the minister away through a secret passage, rushes to the tabernacle too late to prevent the robbery, and makes the great sacrifice of replacing the stolen money by her own ill-gotten hoard before the bewildered police and board officials arrive at the vault. In the final great moment of spiritual exaltation, Naomi has realized the greatness of Bancroft's love and of his power. Meanwhile Wiley, in an attempt to steal the loot from McCarthy, has wrecked the automobile in which they are fleeing and is killed.",

The results convince Prue that the only one in the house with a sense of humor is Meeks, the butler, and a close friendship springs up between the two. He hints to her that he has been to sea and \"seen things\" and when pressed further confides that he was once a Pirate. All Meeks ever saw of the sea was as a cabin boy on a missionary ship, but he spins wild yarns of adventure and Prue, her romantic young nature fired, decides to become a bonny buccaneer.

Hoisting her black flag her aunt's house-boat is attacked and the old lady and Astorbilt captured to fill those capacities.

The rough and tumble life and the crisp salt air cracks Astorbilt's effeminate pink tea veneer and from beneath it the true manhood emerges. Gradually Prue finds her heart also becoming a captive to the changed individual. A fire breaks out and he rescues her at danger to himself. Plunging into the sea with his fair burden he swims to a bell buoy to wait the coming boat. There Prue, with her customary disregard for conventions, promises to lower the black flag and surrender her heart forever.",

    "description": "In hearing the phrase \"Merchant Ivory\", most would arguably first think of lush period drama films of the late 1980s and 1990s adapted from literary sources. For those in the know, many of those insiders who are interviewed for this documentary, it was an independent film company from the early 1960s to the mid 2000s centered on four creatives, most specifically the first two, and each's primary role: producer Ismail Merchant, director James Ivory, screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, and the latest to join the group, composer Richard Robbins. Its filmography largely in chronological order, and which does not solely consist of these period dramas, but which were arguably its most successful, are presented. Their business and personal relationships are discussed, both which are intertwined in that Merchant and Ivory were in a personal relationship for that entire period, Merchant, Ivory and Jhabvala lived together for much of that time, and Merchant and Robbins also embarked on a personal relationship together in Merchant and Ivory's relationship being filled with somewhat open \"extramarital\" (i.e. they never having married) liaisons. Specifically with Merchant and Ivory, the yin and the yang between the two is also presented, Merchant described as the \"con man\" who did anything both to secure funding and reduce costs (their films made on a shoestring, especially considering the expense associated with costume pieces), and Ivory the soft spoken perfectionist. Their method of working also led to the familial atmosphere of their productions, albeit most of the time a dysfunctional family, but one where there was an overall mentality by all involved of making an end product of which they all would be proud. With Ivory the sole surviving member of the foursome at the production of this film, an epilogue of sorts is provided in showing Ivory's professional life, especially since Merchant's unexpected passing in 2005.",

She is paroled, finds her child and steals him from the asylum. After wandering around she finally obtains a position in a department store, where Jim Roberts, superintendent, falls in love with her. They are married, but she fails to tell him of her past. Mabel, also freed from prison, demands that Edith join with her and her side partner in a crime, under threat of exposing her past to Jim. Jordan, a friend of Jim's visits them. He is a detective, and recognizes Edith as a former thief. Further to involve her, Mable, hiding from the police, forces Edith to give her refuge in her home, where she immediately proceeds to steal everything in sight, money being her particular passion. Jordan tells Jim he is harboring a thief and he tells Edith she must leave, but Edith, still fearing Mabel, confesses to the theft of money and Mable is allowed to stay. The two men then plan to trap Mable by placing $400 in a desk. As Edith takes the money from the desk, lights are flashed on and she stands before the two men as the thief. The distracted girl now tells her husband of her first theft to save her baby and of her present attempt to keep her past from him. The men have a battle, the detective gets badly beaten up, but is moved by her great courage, gives her back to Jim and the child and through his efforts she obtains a free pardon. - Review from Variety, May 10, 1918.",

Upon learning that married men are exempt from the Selective Draft, Harold urges his fiancée Mary to wed him quickly, but Mary indignantly threatens to break their engagement. At the twenty-story skyscraper that Harold's father is building, Mary meets Jim Kelly, the contractor's son, and is impressed as he rises on a beam. Jim returns Mary's gloves to her Fifth Avenue address, where Harold insults him. At training camp, Jim, enthusiastic about the draft, is promoted to aviation captain, while Harold, who exhibits cowardice as a captain, is released.

When Mary is abducted by a German prince, Jim pursues on horseback, tumbles over a cliff, swims ashore and arrives in time to rescue her. They then escape in an airplane.",

    "description": "Pennhurst is a documentary film chronicling the stories of many people whose lives are irrevocably intertwined with the history of the Pennhurst State School and Hospital, located outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Once a massive institutional home for the developmentally disabled, Pennhurst exemplified the divisive method of institutionalized care that rose to popularity early in the 20th Century as a result of the Eugenics Movement. Though the facility closed in 1987, its haunting past is a reminder of a place and time that gave birth to a civil rights movement all its own. The Eastern Pennsylvania State School for the Feeble Minded and Epileptic was established in 1908 in order to segregate those deemed \"mentally defective\" and \"feeble minded\" from society. The facility, originally built for a resident population of 1,300, was later renamed \"Pennhurst State School and Hospital.\" The grounds included 17 buildings, among them a farm, stables, a piggery, all interconnected by a labyrinth of underground tunnels, allowing Pennhurst to function completely self-sufficiently. During the course of its first fifty years, Pennhurst's record was marked by a number of scandals involving mistreatment of patients, violence, drug abuse, embezzlement, and neglect by staff. After requests for an investigation into inner workings of the institution by the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens (PARC) in 1968, a young reporter named Bill Baldini brought cameras into Pennhurst for the televised investigative report \"Suffer The Little Children.\" The five-part report was the first time that the conditions inside Pennhurst had ever been exposed to the public. What the world saw in Baldini's report was a cramped, filthy, prison where the mentally handicapped were left to rot, in many cases strapped to their beds, with no hope of rehabilitation. Those higher-functioning individuals who had the misfortune of being grouped with the severely disabled had seen their condition decline, lessening their chances of successfully re-entering society. In 1974, a class action lawsuit was filed, one which was to become a landmark case in the civil rights movement for people with mental retardation. On December 23rd, 1977, a groundbreaking decision was announced, stating that for the first time people with mental retardation have a right to live in the community. This decision led to a mass exodus of residents, many of who were moved into local community living arrangements with support staff. It became the catalyst for the nation-wide deinstitutionalization movement. Over the last few decades Pennhurst has been at the center of much of the legislation that has arisen to guarantee rights and respect for those members of our society whose needs demand our attention and caring. As you will see, many individuals associated with Pennhurst have become leaders on the national front to proliferate understanding, acceptance, and tolerance for all disabled people of our nation. Their efforts culminated in 1990 with the signing of the Americans With Disabilities Act, although the struggle for them and their loved ones is far from over. After Pennhurst officially closed its doors in 1987, the fallout for its former residents and employees was mixed. Some patients were able to make the successful transition to life back in the community; others met with great difficulty on the road to independence, and still others found no viable alternative to institutionalized living. In many cases these individuals had been dumped, literally left at the doorstep of Pennhurst, with no family or home to return to. Despite its evils, Pennhurst was all that many of them had. Today, the former residents of Pennhurst, their families, and the former employees of the institution have moved on from the place that connects their pasts, but the polarizing legacy of that site that once linked them lingers in all of their lives. To some, Pennhurst was a loving home, a refuge from a life of extreme hardship and ostracization. To others it was a house of horrors, a place where society conveniently hid away its 'undesirables' and turned a blind eye to the cruelties and injustices that ensued. Accusations of abuse and neglect were once common on the grounds of the institution, and by reopening the gates of this secretive, secluded world the film sheds light on wrongs committed against those who were unable to tell their story on their own. This film delves beneath the surface of the now defunct Pennhurst State School and Hospital to investigate the personal tales of the people whose memories of Pennhurst range from the nostalgic to the nightmarish. It is a journey into the lives of a group of people who were long without a voice, but whose story is finally being told.",

Carlyle notes the marked difference between him, a fine, manly young fellow, and Herbert, his own son, a ne'er-do-well at college. Herbert is in debt and writes home for money. The railroad president refuses his request. In desperation the boy writes to Genevieve, his attractive young stepmother. She confides in Richard. Herbert calls home secretly and his stepmother promises to help him. Carlyle comes in and sternly demands to know to whom she was talking. She cannot tell him. A note arrives for Genevieve. She tells Carlyle it is from a girl. It is from Herbert, who wishes to meet Richard that evening to get the money. Genevieve goes to acquaint Richard of the appointment and is followed by her husband. He witnesses the meeting and hears Genevieve say, \"On the bridge tonight at eight.\" Carlyle meets Richard at the bridge, seizes him by the throat, and pushes him into the water. John Squires, a surly, cowardly bully, who has been discharged from the railroad, sees the deed. As Carlyle sneaks back Squires insolently steps out and points meaningfully toward the lake. Carlyle is forced to reemploy him on the railroad. Herbert coming to meet Richard, sees his father. When questioned he tells the truth about his appointment. Carlyle can hardly bear the weight of his sorrow. Carlyle goes west, away from the scene of his crime. His son Herbert accompanies him. Engineer Squires, driving the Westbound Express, stands intoxicated, swaying from side to side in the cab. Squires attacks the fireman and tries to throw him from the window. While this is happening, the train tears on toward a runaway engine several miles down the track. In the head-on collision which follows, the cars are thrown from the track and splintered into pieces; clinched locomotives are demolished, belching fire and steam, passengers are hurled from seats and crushed in debris. Carlyle searches for his son. He finds him among the dead. Raising his eyes heavenward, his expression tells he realizes that his punishment is the retributive Justice, \"A Life for a Life.\"",

Her invalid mother, realizing her talents and knowing her ambition to become an expert dancer, made the father promise that Mary should have her heart's desire. When the mother died Mary's father sold the farm and purchased a traveling show to give Mary her chance to be a stage dancer. There was a Madame La Rue in the company, who had a daughter of about Mary's age, and the two girls disagreed, with Mme. La Rue continually inspiring discord. Mary's father is stricken at a time when Mary is on the stage giving her performance, Mme. La Rue has him removed to her own dressing room, and there the old man makes his dying statement to the scheming woman. He tells her where in his trunk he keeps his money; asks that his wealthy brother, in a distant town, be notified of his death, and that Mary be taken to her undo who will provide her from his abundance with a home. Mme. La Rue takes the money from the trunk, wires to Mary's uncle that she is bringing Mary and the body of her father to him, and, deserting Mary, takes her own daughter instead. Mme. La Rue and her child are accordingly, established in luxury. When the authorities disband the juvenile opera company because the owner is dead and there is no one to carry on the show. Mary is taken in charge by a shrewish woman who makes a kitchen slave of the child. Mary bears oppression as long as she can, and then runs away to the town where her father is buried. Near the ocean shore she locates a cottage that offers shelter, even though the owner is not at home. Mary goes to sleep in the bed and awakes next morning to find that a kindly disposed young man, who makes his living fishing with his nets, owns the cottage and straightway offers a home and working partnership. Mary one day meets Phillip, a handsome young author, who is a visitor at the home of Mary's uncle. Mme. La Rue has been trying to ensnare Phillip as a husband for her daughter, Zella, but Phillip is slow to advance. Mary and Phillip meet frequently on the beach, and Bob grows jealous of his rival. One day Mme. La Rue and Zella recognize Mary as she is conversing with Phillip, they also observe Bob's jealous conduct. Going to Bob they tell him that Phillip is engaged to Zella and is only trifling with Mary. Bob in a rage assaults Phillip, and believes that the blow be strikes has killed the young author. Informing Mary of what he has done, the two friends agree that they had better leave the neighborhood and go at once to a distant town. In the years that follow Bob devotes himself to the task of realizing, for Mary, her ambition to become a great dancer. At a society function where Mary is the attraction, Phillip (who has only been stunned by Bob's blow) sees the girl and recognizes his little friend from the fishing village. The renewal of acquaintance discloses Mary's parentage, and the locket she wears proves that she should be occupying the place in her uncle's home that Mme. La Rue had, by fraud, established for Zella. The outcome gives Mary her proper place and we are left to believe that she and Phillip will find their way to happiness.",

Mark begs Hugh to allow him to stake him until his pictures sell, but pleasure in his new clothes and new popularity dwindle as he sees his old friends will not profit by them. A happy idea strikes him and he buys all of Hugh's paintings on exhibition at a local dealer, requesting that his name be not mentioned. Mark rejoices with Hugh when he comes home to tell the news. Then the two decide Doris must also share with them, and together they go to a lawyer, and arrange to persuade him to send a letter to Doris saying her uncle in San Francisco has died leaving her a thousand dollars. In another section of the City Mrs. Trailes and her daughter, Ruby, scheme to ensnare a wealthy husband for the girl. Mark's reputation has impressed them. He is invited to attend a meeting of their Literary Club and the girl is given instructions to attract him. Mark meets the young society girl. Hugh and Doris, she is reporting the meeting, are also there and to them evidences of Mark's awakening infatuation are pitifully clear. Mark sees Ruby often. At a ladies' swimming club he is the guest of her mother. At a sign from her mother Ruby pretends to be drowning and Mark jumps in to her rescue. The friendship thus engendered ripens into love and it is not long before they are married. But early in his wedded life Mark begins to feel the pangs of disillusion. Ruby is pettish and extravagant and when he remonstrates with her, she breaks into tirades of scolding that drive him to silence. Doris discovers her uncle is alive, and, perplexed, goes to the lawyer, who tells her all. She writes to Mark, enclosing a check for the whole amount she has left and promising to send the balance as soon as she can. His wife intercepts the letter and accuses him of infidelity. Her true vulgarity asserts itself and he goes to the little studio. Ruby follows and finds him with Doris and another scene is enacted. Mark begs Hugh to look after Doris, then leaves. Hugh leaves a letter for Doris and a note in which he asks her not to read the letter before she has found happiness. Hugh tells a newspaper reporter with whom he is acquainted that he has inherited a fortune from his grandfather, and the account is printed in the evening paper. Ruby and her mother remember he is a friend of Mark's and ask him to call. Soon a closer intimacy than friendship develops and Mark comes home one evening to find Ruby in his friend's arms. Disillusioned, his last ideal, friendship, completely shattered, Mark hurries away. After the divorce, he seeks Doris and the two become engaged. She remembers the letter and opens it. Herein Hugh has outlined his plans, the story of the fortune was a hoax, wherewith to entrap Ruby. For the sake of friendship he had sacrificed himself to bring happiness to the two he loved. Mark telephones to him and when he comes the old feeling of happiness and love fills once more the little studio in MacDougal Alley.",

In demand for concert and TV appearances, BS&T was a darling of the mainstream and rock press, icon of the counterculture and inspiration for a generation of horn-based bands. Their future was limitless. And then it all went wrong. Created with the full cooperation of Blood, Sweat and Tears, this feature documentary will overflow with great music, international political intrigue, compelling human moments, humor and fresh insight into this strange never-before-told story of a tangle with the Nixon administration, a controversial tour behind the Iron Curtain that put them in the crossfire of a polarized America and a lost tour documentary that might just explain it all.",

Two young chaps, Joe Brill and Jim Kent, were the favored ones, but Joe finally married her. Later Violet travels the \"Path Forbidden,\" carousing with male friends, and is finally driven out by the husband, Joe Brill. She wishes to take one of the twin children, but the husband forbids. So she steals one little girl and takes her away. Years later we see the twins grown to womanhood. Neither know of the existence of the other. Pearl, the stolen one, is leading the life her mother led when alive. Lucy is the aid and comfort of the father, who, through unwise investments, loses his money, the shock of which causes a stroke and is removed to an asylum. Lucy then runs a country hotel. Pearl, the evil sister, has gained the love of an honorable young lawyer, Curtis Holmes, who will not marry her unless she gives up her forbidden life. She promises, and the wedding is announced. At the last moment, a dope and race track tout persuades her to go away with him. Traveling by auto, they have an accident, Pearl is carried to the hotel run by Lucy. The sisters notice the marked resemblance but think it merely a co-incidence. Curtis, missing Pearl, follows to the hotel, where he mistakes Lucy for Pearl, but soon finds out his error. He later finds in Lucy all that he had wished for in Pearl, so he transfers his affections. The father recovers and is brought home by Lucy. Shortly after the barn dance, Pearl disguises as Lucy and in lighting a cigarette sets fire to the place and in trying to escape sprains her ankle and faints from pain. The father, Joe Brill, taking his first stroll in the evening, notices the blaze and is told by the farmers that Lucy is in there. Without thought for himself, he carries Pearl out and takes her to the hotel. There he sees it is not Lucy and memory goes back to two small cradles. Asking her name and her mother's he finds his other daughter, Pearl, discovering a father, something she had never known, resolves to leave the \"Path Forbidden\" and be the comfort of her father who needs her now that Lucy has married Curtis.",

With him dwells his daughter, Fay, whom he idolizes. Fay, who has been blind from her birth, has a wonderful imagination. Even the town and its sordid inhabitants become invested with romance and take their part in the stories of adventures that her father reads to her. While Fay goes about with security and fearlessness, which causes the ignorant to regard her with almost religious respect, her inner life is in sharp contrast. She has secret haunts, where she hides, and in thought recreates fairyland. Her favorite retreat is a cavern formed by an old abandoned tunnel which she peoples with knights and princesses, gnomes and fairy guardians. The one thing lacking is the Prince. And one day he comes. The \"Prince\" is a hunchback, \"Crip\" Halloran, the son of the village drunkard, who stumbles into Fay's imaginary fairyland, and is at once endowed by her with every heroic attribute. Finally Fay's father passes away and Fay becomes a drudge in the hut of ignorant aliens, and the meetings between her and the Prince are few and far between, and \"Crip\" is almost heartbroken. Jack Rockwell, son of a rich mine owner, comes to look after his property. Chance throws him in contact with Fay, and he becomes infatuated with her charm and idealism. He is admitted to the kingdom and gradually dethrones \"Crip,\" to the hunchback's bitter distress. In love and pity for Fay's misfortune, Rockwell secures a great oculist and an operation opens Fay's eyes to the harsh world that her fancy idealized. She sees her two devoted admirers as they really are, and shrinks with horror from the poor misshapen \"Crip.\" Broken-hearted, the hunchback seeks the old cavern and with a revolver ends a life that holds nothing but hopeless misery. Rockwell and Fay visit their old haunt, and with years of love and happiness opening before them discover the body of the poor hunchback, who had once for a few happy hours reigned as a Prince in a fairy realm of a girl's imagination.",

They observed a gang of urchins maltreating a little pup. In trying to assist the little dog Mike and Louie were treated to a bombardment of sundry loose building materials close to the hands of the small boys. But the dog was rescued and Mike and Louie were united in friendship through the common cause of the pup. Mike and Louie sought an adjacent drug store for first aid to the dog. The drug store was operated by an unprincipled person, whose chief trade was in \"dope.\" Mike and Louie happened in just at the time the alleged druggist was apprised that a police raid impended. He was preparing for a hasty retreat. He seized the opportunity and presented Mike and Louie with the drug store until he should return if in return they would keep a little girl Mary, aged ten, who had been left to his care. Mike and Louie become owners of a drug store, guardians to the child, and masters of a pet dog. The police, not knowing that the place had changed hands, decided to raid it. Mike and Louie were dragged to court, where they had to prove that they had just come into possession of the drug store and assumed guardianship of the child. The judge commended them after a pathetic scene and Mike and Louie returned to the drug store. Eight years later the drug store is more dilapidated than ever. Mike and Louie were eking out a bare existence, giving all their money to the education and desires of Mary. Some time during the eight year lapse, Mike and Louie had acquired a clerk. Bob, who had graduated from a school of pharmacy and who had come to them to gather practical experience. Mary and Bob fell in love with each other. Things took a bad turn when the \"Drug Trust\" refused to grant Mike and Louie more credit. They were forced to make spurious drugs. Through an accident Mary learns of the trickery. The next day she imparted to Bob the details of her discovery. Contrary to her expectations, he laughed and told her that it was far more harmless to sell the stuff that Mike and Louie were making than the actual dope which was harmful to the customers. In the midst of the explanation Mike and Louie came in and saw the two youngsters in an embrace. They demanded that Bob stop his love making. He replied that he intended to marry Mary. He was told that if he had any business ability he would be working some place for a salary instead of with Mike and Louie for nothing, and to make the thing harder Mike suggested that before Bob marry Mary, he make a million to buy her all the little trinkets that she might want. Bob decided to make a million for Mary. Sitting in the park reading the paper, an article on the new \"Science of Mind\" caught his eye. He stopped to think and recalled his argument with Mary that it isn't what you take, but it is what you believe when you take it. So Bob got the great idea. Bob rushed back to the drug store and imparted his idea to Mike and Louie, who merely scoffed and asked him where he would get the money with which to advertise and distribute the wonderful pills. Bob had an idea and betook himself to the \"Drug Trust\" and impressed them with the fact that he had the greatest drug panacea ever discovered. They drew up a contract with him, and agreed to pay Mike and Louie one million dollars on date of distribution of the pills. An enormous system of advertising was instituted. All over the world appeared the legend, \"Mike's and Louie's panacea for all ills, take a pill every hour, pray and have faith.\" Orders flocked in from every portion of the globe. The night before the day upon which the pills were to be released. Mike, Louie, Bob and Mary were so engrossed in their work that they forgot poor Fritz, the dog. who became hungry and ate a cake of soap. Finally he was discovered by Mike, who knew he was sick. They looked for remedies and could find none, when Louie had the great idea that if the pills could help people, they could help the dog. But Mike answered that the dog could not pray. However, they decided they would pray for him so Fritz was handed a bunch of pills. Unknown to Mike and Louie, the pills contained a light narcotic, so that when taken in large quantities they caused profound sleep. They thought that the pills had killed him. Immediately they had visions of thousands upon thousands of dead people, all of whom had taken the pills. After due consideration they made a suicide pact deciding to kill themselves with their own pills. Mike and Louie slept and dreamed that they had gone to Heaven. Here they met the druggist, Mike, certain that the druggist was in the wrong place, decided to throw him out This started the noise. Mike, Louie and the druggist were dragged before St. Peter. Mike woke up. Outside the drug store the crowd had gathered, led by officers of the \"Drug Trust.\" They heard the noise and were certain that the relations of the dead people who had taken pills had come to wreak vengeance on them. Finally they were quieted and handed what was found to be a check for a million. Thus did Mary get her million, and Bob his Mary.",

Arriving at Leipzig, she is at once put to work by her Aunt, who is a very capable business woman. Great as is the contrast between her present life in Leipzig as compared with that of her native village, she sighs for life in Berlin where, as her favorite line of fiction tells her, beautiful young girls can have the world at their feet. Not long after her debut in the garment store, enters Sigmund Phillippsohn, salesman for a wholesale garment house in Berlin. He is the friend of everyone in the shop and there ensues a flutter of excitement from Amelia down to the errand girls. He sees Gertie and she scores a hit upon his nice discernment. He invites her Aunt and her to dine with him that evening, and then wires his house that he has found a perfect thirty-six and asking if he will hire her. His house answers telling him to \"send, her along.\" He broaches the subject to Gertie and finds her more than willing to accept. The next day she airily trips from the shop, giving her poor Aunt an unexpected and unwelcome farewell. Arriving at Mayer and Nathanson's cloak and suit emporium in Berlin, the green girl does not make an immediate hit with Mayer, but she is taken on. Moritz Abramowsky, however, sees the diamond in the rough and determines to get in her good graces. He invites her to supper with him and she gladly accepts. A sad awakening; the frugal Moritz takes her to a beanery of the type where the waiters yell, \"draw one in the dark\" and \"ham and.\" While Moritz is foraging among the eatables of a neighboring table, the house salesman of Mayer and Nathanson enters in search of Gertie and carries her off to a real restaurant. Gertie's rise in the business is rapid. The princess of the royal family calls at the emporium to select a costume. The various models parade before her in all their refinery, but of them all it is Gertie who makes the hit. Through her skillful showing, the princess purchases liberally and leaves, stating that she desires Miss Gertie to always wait upon her in the future. The fame of her ability travels, and she is offered a position at double her present salary by a rival concern. Gertie decides to accept it, and so does not go down to business that day. It so happens that the princess requests Mayer to call at the palace that very day and bring Miss Gertie with him to show the new gowns. Alarmed by the model's absence, he accepts Moritz's advice and calls upon the absent girl in person. He persuades her to go with him to the palace. At the conclusion of a most successful call he determines to make the girl his for all time, proposes and is accepted.",

Their faithful servant, Joseph, has been wont to withhold the threats of debtors from them, but there comes a time, shortly after the father's death, that Ralph must be told the truth. Joseph tells everything and suggests that Ralph accept money that he has saved and go to Paris, where he may show the world his art. Ralph does so and goes to live with the Gardins. His uncle Victor Valentine, wealthy and fond of gay life, invites him to live at his home provided he will leave behind his foolish dreams and fancies. Ralph refuses, preferring to remain where he is. He wins the love of Pauline Gardin and is quite content. Through his Bohemian acquaintances he meets Mme. Flora Margot. This tired, blasé young woman makes a pet of him and enraptured by her dazzling beauty he longs to satisfy her every desire. Attempting to do so, he becomes indebted to impatient creditors, who demand immediate payment or his arrest. Pauline, ignorant of his infatuation with Flora, assists him out of his present difficulties with her own savings. Realizing Flora's fast waning affection, he resolves to regain it by buying a certain antique necklace which he knows she covets. The antique dealer demands an exorbitant price which he is unable to pay. He is further disheartened when one day he finds her in the arms of his uncle, and he rushes forth intent upon suicide. About to throw himself into the river, a vision of Flora appears before him and he resolves to secure the necklace at any cost. The dealer of the antique shop is busy when he enters and Ralph wanders into a room where there are curios upon the walls and tables. Curiously examining the various articles, his hand suddenly touches a secret panel which springs back, revealing a marvelous painting of the Christ. A spiritual influence comes over him, so profound is its impression upon his mind. While awaiting the attendance of the dealer, he becomes greatly interested in a peculiar skin which has writing upon it in Sanskrit. Sitting down he becomes drowsy and falls asleep. The writing changes into English, which reads that the possessor of the skin has only to wish and his wish will be granted, but that with each desire the skin shall grow smaller and the days of the possessor grow less until death is the penalty at the last wish. The dealer approaches and Ralph is amazed to behold him now in the form of a devil. The devil asks if he desires the skin and Ralph, fearfully undecided, suddenly thinks of Flora and agrees to take it. What are his desires and his terrible anguish as the talisman grows smaller have been woven into a story of weird and mystic situations.",

She was willing to work and slave, if need be, to keep her baby brother, affectionately termed \"The Lump,\" from being sent to the poor house. So she did housework and prepared breakfasts for John Ruffin, an attorney, and Hon. Gedge-Tompkins. John Ruffin's sister, Lady Osterly, has separated from her husband, and he holds their child. When Lady Osterly calls on Ruffin she is struck with the remarkable resemblance Polly bears to her own child. Ruffin and Lady Osterly formulate a plan to come into possession of her daughter, by using Polly as a substitute. When they offer Polly twenty sovereigns to go to the Duke of Osterly's home and impersonate the other child, the amount of money fairly staggers Polly and she accepts. By changing the children when the child of the Osterly's is out riding with her nurse. Polly gains access to the Duke's home and the Osterly child comes to John Ruffin's apartments to stay until her mother can get her ticketed to the continent and travel away with her. Polly does the best she can under strange conditions, but despite her resemblance to the Osterly child, the servants are suspicious and the Duke falls to wondering what has happened. Young Lord Ronald, visiting the Duke, is above all suspicious of Polly. The Osterly girl is under similar suspicion at Ruffin's home. \"The Lump\" positively declines to have anything to do with her. There is a blunder in the preparations Lady Osterly and John Ruffin make for the European trip. Polly disregards positive instructions and leaves the Osterly mansion before plans can be worked out. The Duke follows Polly in his automobile, searching for her in a nearby park where she has liked to go with young Lord Ronald to play. Finding Polly where he thought he would the Duke carries her back to his home. Here John Ruffin directly arrives, to tell the Duke that his wife and child must, by that time, be well on their way across the Channel. Lady Osterly, through miscalculation, has become worried because Ruffin does not arrive with the tickets and telephones him at the Duke's (her husband's) home. The servants call the Duke in answer to the summons and thus husband and wife find themselves talking to each other, much to their mutual surprise, as well as secret delight. As a result of this accidental 'phone call, a reconciliation is effected and everything ends happily for everybody, including Polly Redhead, who has made a great conquest of young Lord Ronald's heart.",

    "description": "John Humperdink Stover, otherwise known as \"The Varmint\" for his pestiferousness or as \"Dink\" when in special favor, was expelled from a boarding school and sent to Lawrenceville Academy. On the stage on the way to the school he meets a silent man whom Dink sizes up for a salesman and he proceeds to wax eloquent on the subject of his past career and the reason he was expelled from his previous school. The \"salesman\" is actually the professor of Latin known to the boys as the \"Roman.\" Dink boasts that in a week he will have the boys at the school in his power. A strange uneasiness grips him when he sees that he does not make just the impression he expected. Little by little he succeeds in making himself the most thoroughly disliked and abhorred person on the campus. Dink rises a point in his schoolmates' estimation when he discovers on reporting to the Latin class that the instructor is no other than the traveling man of the stage on the day of his arrival, and in order to make good some of the many boasts he made on that day fakes the translation. The Roman, possessed of a good sense of humor, compliments \"Dink\" on his performance, much to everyone's surprise. The first girl to attract Dink Stover is the pretty daughter of the Roman, considerably older than he is. After a short and one-sided flirtation, Miss McCarty becomes engaged to another man and Dink is desperate until some new neckwear arrives at the local haberdasher's and diverts his mind from his agony. As a result of his neglect of study, Dink finds himself about to be dropped in school for falling off in his studies. He is to have a private examination at the Roman's house. Stover decides to cheat, and arranges with the Tennessee Shad and MacNooder to overturn a large water cooler outside the Roman's door and other devices to get him out of the way. To his utter dismay, the Roman goes out of the room and stays, thus putting him on his honor. Dink signs his name at the head of the blank paper and is dumbfounded when, upon the Roman's return, he seems to scan the blank sheets closely and says : \"I think this will about pass you, Stover.\" The two discover that they had been friends from the first and Dink really comes into his own when the Roman explains that as he is now an upperclassman, he must set a good example for the younger boys.",

The British government have built a top-secret research facility was built at the site to keep the spot under observation. Albert, a staff scientist, warns his Chief Doug that the signals have wandered outside of their normal range as if a critical point has been reached. At the facility for the first time that day are Doug's son Trent and a young woman, Jenny, who have just been added to the Area 51 staff. They are being shown the facility when, suddenly, there are alarms at the portal. As two scientists peer into a swirling glow, a couple of large arms appear. It is followed by the rest of a giant baboon-like creature with huge teeth. This is soon followed by a hoard of hostile insect crawlers about the size of cattle. The few armed guards positioned at the mouth of the passage are totally inadequate to stop the onslaught. Doug grabs Trent and Jenny to head for a secure bunker at a close military base while more creatures of both kinds spill into the neighborhood. Doug is able to gain entry into the bunker by announcing his position at Area 51. Already there, imploring to be let in, are a man and two women from a nearby nightclub. The older woman suffered a wound from one of the creatures en route and is now infected with snaky parasites anxious for new hosts.",

Virginia and Warren were betrothed and Warren was sowing his last \"wild oats\" before settling down and becoming a partner in his father's business. Dudley objected to Warren's pranks, while Todd liked the idea of his boy displaying a little \"ginger.\" Finally, Warren was sued by a chorus girl for breach of promise and Dudley declared that he should never marry Virginia, while Todd declared he would not allow Warren to marry her. When Warren told his father that he still intended to make Virginia his wife or leave home forever, Todd told him to go and when he left Todd's soul shriveled even smaller, and he became more of a grouch than ever, until his heart was actually affected and the doctor ordered him to go to Arizona. While he is snowbound in a trapper's cabin at Christmas, a little boy makes him rejoice in the realization of God's great works, and touches the spring that opens his shriveled soul. Fate restores Warren to his father, and Dudley, having heard of Todd's predicament, takes Dorothy with him; there is a general reunion. Warren thoroughly cured of his wildness, completes the pact that he and Virginia had made: and the boy, who had been the cause of Todd's rejuvenation, starts life as a millionaire.",

Instead, she loves his money and she enters the primrose path with Garlan in order to satisfy her love for finery. Garlan, a roué, also neglects his infant son, Wynne, for worldly pleasures. In time Daisy Brooks' double life is discovered by her husband, and she kills herself in Garlan's mansion. At the appearance of Roanoke, who has followed, Garlan jumps from a window and kills himself. Roanoke buys a little farm where he lives with his daughter. With the passing years, Elizabeth, daughter of Roanoke, reaches womanhood and is known to her father as \"Sweet Alyssum.\" Wynne Garlan, son of Robert Garlan, has grown to manhood and has married a woman of the world. Wynne, a poor bank clerk, is unable to provide for his wife in the way she wishes and she enters into an affair with Thurlow, the cashier of the bank where Wynne is employed. Thurlow steals from the bank and causes Wynne to be suspected of the crime. Wynne, in terror of arrest, escapes, and arrives in the country near Roanoke Brooks' farm. Sweet Alyssum dreams that her father's land has developed into an immense oil field. She pleads with him to dig for oil and he does so. Wynne Garlan, who has assumed the name of Wyatt, secures employment on Roanoke Brooks' farm. Wynne, later becomes a school teacher and Sweet Alyssum, his pupil, loves him dearly. He, for a time, withstands the innocent young girl's endearments but finally succumbs to her beauty and they elope and are married. When Roanoke Brooks hears of the marriage he is overcome with anger, but as he confronts the pair upon their return to the farm, oil is discovered. Joyful because Alyssum's dream has been realized, Roanoke Brooks forgives the couple and they reside with him. Two years pass by and Sweet Alyssum has become a mother. The oil fields have prospered and all is happiness in Roanoke Brooks' home. Thurlow, the crooked bank clerk, has not prospered during these years and finally wanders to the oil fields. There he sees Wynne Garlan. Thurlow informs the sheriff of the county that Wynne Garlan, known there as Wyatt, is a crook, and that if he is married he is guilty of bigamy for he has a wife living. The sheriff, upon Thurlow's instigations, telegraphs to New York and receives a reply to hold Wynne Garlan, who is wanted by the law. The justice of the peace, who is a friend of Roanoke Brooks and of Sweet Alyssum, goes to Roanoke's home to break the sad news. Roanoke determines to take the law into his own hands. The prosecuting attorney of the county also appears to get information from Sweet Alyssum concerning her husband's actions. When Sweet Alyssum is informed that her husband is accused of bigamy, she sacrifices even her own reputation for him and exclaims: \"He cannot be charged with bigamy, for we were never married.\" Wynne Garlan leaves the magistrate's office and goes to Roanoke Brooks' home. As he enters the gate, he is seen by Roanoke Brooks, who seizes a rifle. As he is about to fire on Wynne, Sweet Alyssum places her little child between her father's rifle and her husband. Then a message comes from the police department of the city which reads as follows: \"Garlan obtained divorce two years ago. No charge against him for bank robbery. Hold Thurlow. He is your man.\" Then it is that the girl tells her father that what she said about Wynne not marrying her was false as she wanted to protect him from arrest. And as Roanoke Brooks gathers his beloved daughter into his arms and shakes Wynne by the hand, the magistrate and the prosecuting attorney retire from the scene and are later instrumental in capturing Thurlow.",

Cort is a young architect whose struggles have netted him a bankroll of hardly more than $300. His financial straits are rendered more desperate when a hobo, injured in a nearby railroad wreck, is brought to his home for treatment. Despite the doctors' bills John and Barbara nurse the outcast back to health. In an attempt to raise some money, Barbara decides to try and sell a play she wrote at school. The hobo suggests she send it to Phillip Allen, a big producer. She does and to her amazement it is accepted. Simultaneously, John gets a commission from Mrs. Stoddard, a wealthy society woman. In attempting to conceal good fortune from each other for the surprise of their glorious fulfillments, many misunderstandings arise between Bab and John. She sees him with Mrs. Stoddard and believes the worst. He sees her with Allen and suspects her perfidy. The breaking point is almost reached when Bab's play comes out a tremendous success. John reads of it and his wife's authorship in the newspapers, then reveals to her his success. The two are brought to a happy reconciliation with the hobo as their fairy god-father, for it develops that it was through his former friendship with Allen that Bab's play was accepted; and also that Mrs. Stoddard, in reality, is his daughter.",

    "description": "Ed Andrews, a young shipping clerk, is in love with Dora Birch, and has as rival Tom Matthews, but wins the girl, much to his mother's satisfaction. A raise in salary hastens their marriage and two years later their baby arrives. Andrews, celebrating the event, goes to the corner bar with George Gardner, his chum, and, after several drinks, Gardner gets into a fight with Jim Matthews, Tom's brother, knocking him down with a blow, Matthew's head striking the pavement, causing his death. George runs away, and Ed bends over Matthews, trying to raise him. The crowd threatens him and he starts to run, but is soon caught. In the morning he is fined for disorderly conduct, and is near freedom when word comes that Matthews is dead, and he is held for murder. Tom is a ward detective, and four months after the arrest, swears that Jim was killed while resisting highway robbery. Ed is sentenced to death, and the shock kills his wife, his mother taking the child and rearing her. She pleads with the Governor, and in view of the evidence he commutes Ed's sentence to imprisonment for life. His mother tells him of his wife's death, and, with his nerve crushed, he begins his prison life. Nineteen years later his daughter falls in love with Paul Matthews, son of the man who had sworn away his life. Ed's mother continues her efforts in his behalf, and Gardner, dying in a distant city, tells the truth about the assault. Ed is pardoned and meets his daughter for the first time in the warden's office. Ed and his daughter are having luncheon on the beach when he sees a man fall from a boat, swims out to save him and brings him to shore, but the man is dead and Ed recognized the body as that of Tom Matthews, the brother of the man his friend had killed, and on whose evidence he had spent twenty years in prison. Then he feels that while nothing can give him back his lost youth, his wasted life and the wife he loved, he has overtaken the man who was responsible for his troubles.",

The children's step-father, heavily in debt and tired of the burden imposed by the little family, abandons his farm, leaving the children, penniless, to shift for themselves. The following day Daniel Banning, a wealthy \"country gentleman\" and owner of the Fairfax farm, calls to collect back rent. He finds Mona and her children panic-stricken over a note left by their step-father, telling of his decision to leave. Banning turns a deaf ear to Mona's pleas that she be allowed to remain on the farm with her wards. He notifies the Children's Welfare Society. Directors of the society go to the farm, load them into an automobile, and take them to the society's headquarters. At headquarters the chairman calls for volunteers to take the children into their homes. A square-jawed woman, a miserly old man, a brutal fellow, with bull-dog features, and a ponderous, harsh, mannish looking women, each agree to take a child. When it dawns upon Mona and her brothers and sisters that they are to be separated they break into tears and beg piteously to be allowed to remain together. Their pleas are ignored. Finally Mona begs that they be allowed to spend a last night together on the Fairfax farm. The request finally is granted. That night Mona hitches the family horse to a rickety old wagon and the children set out to escape. They fall asleep and the horse stops near Banning's house. The housekeeper takes them in during the master's absence. When Banning returns he is furious. Mona offers him a wisp of flowers, which he scorns. Finally, however, the child's smile wins his heart and he cuddles her. Later when agents of the welfare society try to take the children, Banning drives them from his place, declaring he will adopt Young Mother Hubbard and her entire family.",

Banished for the \"bride theft,\" Peer begins a worldwide wandering, and his susceptibility to beautiful women plunges him into thrilling experiences. But one after another they reveal selfish ends and work to his undoing. He loses his sailing ship and narrowly escapes irons when his beautiful Annabel Lee turns out to be an agent of the secret service on his trail for slaving. By mere luck he emerges unscathed from the duel he is dragged into by an aristocratic little flirt of old Virginia. An Indian girl in the north woods inveigles him out of his precious pelt of silver fox and then deserts him, and his escape from lurking redskins is by such a hair that a rifle bullet knocks the very paddle out of his hands. Years pass but do not bring him any better women, and he falls victim to the voluptuous charm of Anitra a soulless dancing girl of the desert, only to have her strip him of the very gems in his turban and the rings upon his fingers. Age finds him an embittered, cynical old man, and \"Peer Gynt\" drifts back to Gubrandsdale to die, but he finds waiting there the faithful sweetheart of his wild youth, the pure, gentle Solveig. So when the Button Moulder, personifying the Saver of Souls, comes to cast Peer back into the Melting Pot to be molded over because his wasted life proves him without design, it is Solveig's devotion which saves him. The good in him has lived after all in her faith, in her hope and in her love.",

He makes no open declaration of his affection, though, and his brother Louis woos and wins her. Unable to stand the jealousy their marriage arouses, Raimond goes to Vienna, where he engages in riotous living. His father's death calls him home, but he is unable to watch the intimacy of the woman he loves with his brother, and he leaves for India where he stays for several years, becoming versed in the ways of the Hindu. A letter from his nephew Paul asks him to come back. Believing he has stifled the jealousy that sent him away, he returns. The green-eyed monster attacks him with irresistible force and calling into play a curious box, that somewhere in its mechanism contains a drop of cobra poison, he gives it to his brother whose inquisitiveness over its mysterious nature releases a hidden spring and the virus is injected into his blood. He secretes the body in a casket, another of his possessions obtained in India. The casket guards his secret until Claire becomes suspicious and accuses him of the deed. His mind, brooding over his crime, becomes deranged and although pleading innocence, leads Claire to the casket and throws open the lid. The shock of unexpectedly seeing her dead husband kills her. Again Raimond escapes suspicion, but as time elapses he forms a dislike for his nephew, until, becoming obsessed with the idea of showing Paul what is inside of the chest, he drags the frightened child to the heavy box and shows him all that is left of what was once his father. Later, after becoming a raving maniac. Raimond falls dead at the sight of his brother's skeleton.",

    "description": "At the age of eight, Wagner plays for his dying step-father. When sixteen he studies with Cantor Weinlig. Then follows a period of dissipation. In 1834 he is offered the position of conductor of the Lauchstadt Opera. He first refuses, but, meeting the leading actress, Wilhelmina Planer, he accepts. In 1836 he is conductor at Konigsherg, and marries \"Minna.\" They quarrel over his extravagance, but are reconciled in time to greet their friends. In 1838 Wagner is conductor at Riga. While rehearsing he is interrupted by his creditors. Assisted by his friend Moller, he eludes them and the Cossack sentries. He reaches a German seaport, where he boards a small sailing vessel and starts for Paris. During the voyage a terrific storm inspires \"The Flying Dutchman.\" Arriving in Paris he calls upon Meyerbeer and plays parts of \"Rienzi\" for him. Meyerbeer gives him letters, among them one to the director of the Paris Opera, who, however, reuses to do anything. He calls upon Liszt, who receives him cordially. Minna is disheartened by his failures, but when things are at the worst, he receives a letter from his brother-in-law calling him to Dresden to produce \"Rienzi.\" \"Rienzi\" is successfully produced in 1842, and at the age of 30 Wagner is appointed conductor of the Dresden Opera. He again extravagantly furnishes a home. \"The Flying Dutchman\" is produced and fails. His creditors become urgent, and when \"Tannhauser\" falls he is dismissed. Bakunin, a Russian revolutionary, persuades him to join the uprising of 1849. He addresses a meeting and arouses great enthusiasm. The insurrection is quelled and Wagner is forced to flee, being aided by Liszt. He goes to Zurich. He reads the libretto of the \"Niebelung's Ring\" for a party of friends, among them being von Bulow and his wife, Cosima, the daughter of Liszt. During the reading, scenes from the \"Ring\" are shown, inspired by the beautiful Fran Wesendonck. Wagner begins \"Tristan and Isolde.\" Their friendship arouses Minna's jealousy and, after a quarrel, they separate. King Ludwig of Bavaria, sends for Wagner and establishes him in Munich in the Spring of 1864. The King's ministers seek Wagner's assistance, which he refuses. They manage to have him sent away. He goes to Lucerne, where the King visits him during the composition of \"The Master-singers,\" Cosima, having separated from von Bulow, comes to Wagner and they are married in 1870. Bright days come: the Festspielhaus and Wahnfried are built at Bayreuth. Kaiser Wilhelm attends the opening performance. Ludwig receives Wagner and his family. \"Parsifal\" is produced July 26, 1882. February 13, 1883, Wagner dies in Venice. The last picture shows the dead master surrounded by the characters he had created.",

    "description": "David Whiting belongs to a fine old aristocratic family of the south and is an officer in the United States Army. He believes in the Union and he is opposed to slavery. When the Civil War breaks out he frees his personal slaves and joins his regiment to fight for the north. His brother, Walker, is an honorable man, but hot-headed and impetuous, the opposite of his brother. He joins the southern army fighting against his brother. Edith Whiting, the sister, and her parents are extremely bitter over David's defection. The play opens shortly before the Civil War, when David is visiting his home with a friend and brother officer, Jack Spencer, who is engaged to Edith. Edith quarrels with Spencer over their differences in principles and returns his engagement ring. David is in love with Ruth Tyler. During the war the Whiting family, deserted by the slaves, have a hard time to make ends meet, and borrow from a professional money-lender, Thomas Spicer, giving mortgages on their property. Spicer is anxious that his son be recognized by the better class of people. He is ambitious for him to marry Edith Whiting. Edith always spurns him, even though word reaches her that Spencer has been killed. After the war David, now a colonel, returns to his home town with his troops as military commander of the district. He pays off the debts on the plantation and saves his sister from further humiliation at the hands of Spicer. A few days afterward Spicer is found murdered. Walker Whiting is found leaning over the body. A gun belonging to Walker is found by the man's side. It is well known that there was bitter feeling between Walker and Spicer, so he is arrested and accused of the murder. It devolves on David to court-martial and try his own brother. However, Rufus, a slave, confesses he killed Spicer because he once horsewhipped him. Although David had done all of this and much more for his family, had restored order and saved the residence from great humiliation and outrage, both his family and all his old friends are still cold to him. The sting of victory comes when the woman he had long loved, Ruth Tyler, rejects him and throws herself into the arms of his brother. David has won the fight for his principles, but lost the girl.",

    "description": "Only a seven-passenger motor and $100, to be spent exclusively for gasoline or repairs, was Arnold Baird's share of his father's property. Light-hearted by nature, Baird made the most of his legacy and started a \"jitney bus\" line. When James Bennett, general manager of the Consolidated Traction Co., learned Baird had been practically cut off in his father's will, he informed Baird that his daughter would never marry a pauper and to go out and make his fortune. Bennett's decision suited Mrs. Bennett, who was eager to shine in society and planned to gain her ends by marrying Ruth to Wm. Mott-Smith, who controlled the traction company. When Ruth got the chance to tell Mr. Mott-Smith what she thought of him, she left no room for doubt. Ruth met Baird secretly and she was first to know of Baird's jitney-bus plans. Israel Helmstone, leader of organized labor, decided that the employees of the Consolidated Traction Co. deserved an increase in pay. Bennett refused Helmstone's demands and the labor leader called Baird into consultation. Helmstone's daughter, Wanda, employed as stenographer by Mr. Mott-Smith, furnished inside information that showed the weakness of Bennett's defense. The car strike was called and traffic paralyzed. The next morning the \"Social Rapid Transit Company\" sprang into operation. Mott-Smith, Bennett and their associates were filled with consternation. Baird's pals in society entered their cars for public patronage and \"jitney bused\" the traction company to its knees. When strike-breakers were called in there was nobody to ride, for the public preferred the limousines. When Bennett cried for mercy, Baird was the intermediary. Fate decreed that Baird should be the one to rush to Mott-Smith's office to rescue Wanda Helmstone from the clutches of the drunken society leper. Settling with Bennett was no hard matter for Baird. His terms were $10,000 a year for becoming assistant general manager and six months' vacation to enjoy a honeymoon on which Ruth was to be the bride.",

Eliza hearing she is to be separated from her baby makes her escape to join her husband, George Harris, who with Vance, were well on their way to freedom. Learning of the departure, Haley immediately puts the hounds on her trail. The searching party arrives on the river bank in time to see Eliza leaping over the broken ice, upon which the dogs and men feared to tread. A second party is organized by lawyer Marks, but fails to capture the fugitive, who has been befriended by a kindly Quaker and has in the meantime joined her husband. During the sail to Haley's plantation Tom's attention from his Bible is attracted by the cry of \"Overboard.\" Making a bold rush, this wonderful old man leaps into the water and brings little Eva St. Clair, who had wandered from her Aunt and fallen overboard, to safety. This noble deed caused his purchase by St. Clair, who treated him with every kindness, making him a companion for his small daughter Eva, who joyed in Uncle Tom's explanation of the Bible. Sadness finally comes when little Eva dies and a second calamity when her father is killed while separating two roughs in a quarrel. This necessitates the sale of his slaves and property. Uncle Tom falls into the hands of Simon Legree, the most brutal slave owner of the South. His life here is simply a matter of how long it can last under the terrible strain and treatment he receives. The final blow came when Legree's housekeeper, Casey, and his favorite slave, Emmeline, escape during one of his debauches. Going to Tom, he demanded to know their whereabouts. Being unable to give this information, Tom is flogged and cast into a corner to die. Young Shelby, now a man, searches the South to fulfill his youthful promise to buy Tom. He reaches the little hut just in time to cheer the dying hour of his old slave, who has just enough life left to show his gratitude.",

    "description": "Daniel Mylrea is the son of the Bishop of Man, the baron of the Isle of Man, whose temporal power is higher even than that of the Deemster, or governor. The Bishop desires Dan to become a minister, but he prefers to be a fisherman. The Deemster of Man has a son and a daughter, Mona and Ewan. Dan and Mona are in love. She consents to marry him when he can obtain her father's consent. Ewan, her brother, decides to become a clergyman, even in the face of his father's insistence that he take up business as a vocation. The Deemster opposes Dan's suit for Mona's hand because he has fallen from his high estate as the son of the Bishop by becoming a fisherman. His dislike turns to open hatred when Dan endeavors to borrow money from Ewan, whom he thought his friend, to pay off the crew of his boat. Dan had squandered his earnings of the season in drink. Ewan refuses Dan the loan, who makes him a bitter enemy by knocking him down on his taunt that spending money in drink is as bad as theft. Dan is now opposed in his love for Mona by both her father and brother. The Deemster forbids Dan to come to his house to visit her. Despite this, he sees her at night. Though this meeting is innocent in intent, the Deemster uses it to inflame the mind of Ewan against Dan, whom he supposes has dishonored his sister. Arming himself with a knife, Ewan seeks Dan and comes upon him at his cabin while he is mending his nets. They quarrel and Ewan falls backward over a cliff and is killed. Dan's crew of fishermen throw the body into the sea, hoping to hide his death, but the tide sweeps it ashore. It is discovered and suspicion of murder falls on Dan. He is arrested by the Deemster's constables and committed to jail, where he is visited at night by his father, the Bishop, who gives him an opportunity to escape. Dan refuses to go, feeling that he must atone for Ewan's death. Dan is tried on Tynwald Hill, the ancient law mount. The Deemster insists that the Bishop shall exercise his legal prerogative as the highest civil power on the isle and sit at this trial. He aims to force the Bishop to sentence his own son on the gallows. Dan is convicted. The Deemster insists on the death sentence being passed by the Bishop, who, instead of condemning Dan to be hanged, decrees that his son shall be cut off from the people, no tongue to speak to him, no hand to touch him, and. in death, no hand to bury him. Dan is driven away, and for seven years lives alone in a hut by the sea. Then a plague strikes the people of Man. The Bishop has learned of a monk in Ireland who has discovered an antidote for the pestilence and sends for him. The monk comes to the isle on a vessel which is wrecked on the shore near Dan's desolate hut. He dies in Dan's arms, who then dons the monk's garb and carries the antidote to the people, as he had been commanded by the dying cleric. When there is but one powder of the antidote left Dan learns that the Deemster is a victim of the plague. When he faces his enemy to minister to him. he finds himself stricken. Either he or the Deemster must die. Revealing himself to the Deemster he chooses to die himself, hopeless under his father's irrevocable sentence to a living death. Giving the Deemster the healing powder he staggers away to his hut. There he is followed by Mona and dies in her arms.",

    "description": "Tom Mingle, a pony express rider, is on his way to the settlement where Sally Madison, the daughter of a settler, has her abode with her brother, Luke, who spends his time dozing and dreaming. The scenes in this picture are laid during the days of '49, when the intrepid frontiersmen battled with the Indians for supremacy and when the scalp of man, woman or child of the white race was the token of an Indian's bravery and right to be called a man. Tom is in haste not only because the carrying of the mails require swiftness, but because he wants to see Sally, his sweetheart. He arrives within a short distance of the village where Sally lives when his attention is attracted by a dust cloud and the thunderous clamor of an approaching buffalo herd. He spurs his horse to reach the village before the herd passes as he does not want to be cut off, but his eagle eye discerns a swiftly moving, girlish figure ruining in front of the madly stampeding buffalo in an endeavor to escape them. Tom dashes in pursuit and after a desperate and breathless struggle, seizes the exhausted girl, and dashes on just ahead of the approaching buffalo. It is not until after this has been accomplished that he recognizes Sally, who rewards his gallantry and bravery with a warmth of affection that makes him all the more in love with her. In the village the story of the rescue is told, but it is considered an incident and of no considerable importance, because the hazards of frontier life are taken as a matter of course. Tom unstraps the mail pouch and there are letters for several of the settlers. Among them is a letter for Luke, Sally's brother. He reads it and with unconcealed fright and dismay, gives the letter to Sally. Tom helps her to read it. The letter is from Sally's father, Col. Madison, who is in the California gold fields. He writes and says that he has \"made his strike\" and is getting rich; that Sally's mother is very ill and Sally must reach her bedside as speedily as possible. Col. Madison appeals to his son, Luke, saying, \"Remember the vow you made to bring Sally to us.\" He encloses a bag of gold dust. Lazy, shiftless Luke has forgotten his promise. He reiterates the excuses which he has made to Sally before, and declines to take her to the gold fields to join their parents. The exhibition of the bag of gold dust from the California mines, has excited the lust for riches in the breasts of all. Tom declares that he will lead Sally into this new land of promise and other settlers announce a desire to join the party. In a short time arrangements have been completed for the departure from the village of a train of fifty \"prairie schooners.\" At night the wagons are entrained in a circle, while sentries are posted to prevent the approach of war-like Indians. One night while Tom is acting as a sentinel, his instinct warns him of danger. As he stands by the side of a tree, alert and listening, a silent arrow wings its way within an inch of him and buries its head in the tree trunk. An Indian creeps up behind him, springs on him and they engage in a desperate hand to hand struggle until Tom, at last victorious, hurls his assailant over the precipice. He then rushes to the camp and gives the alarm. But the Indians are there in great force. They surround the circle of wagons and dash madly around and around, shooting their bows and arrows until one after another the settlers are shot down. At last only Tom and Sally remain alive. The Indians dash into the camp and proceed to scalp their victims, while Tom and Sally pretend to be dead. Then Chief Swift Wind, who is in command of the war party, notices that the two are alive. They are taken to the camp as prisoners. Chief Swift Wind falls in love with Sally while Starlight, the Chief's sister, becomes enamored of Tom. The Indians having heard great things of the prowess of intrepid Tom, determine to compel him to run the gantlet, a frightful ordeal which consists in compelling the prisoner to dash at full speed between two lines of Indians armed with tomahawks, spears, clubs, etc. If he succeeds in running the gantlet that is passing through the lines of Indians he is permitted to escape. But few prisoners accomplish this. Starlight has hidden horses where Tom can find them and notifies him of this fact before he begins running the gantlet. Tom attempts unsuccessfully to escape and take Sally with him. Their captivity continues for a long period. At times they almost succeed in getting away only to be recaptured. Chief Swift Wind tries to win Sally, while Starlight his sister, falls in love with Tom. Were it not for these conditions both would have been slaughtered long ago. Sally and Tom escape finally to the camp of a band of buffalo hunters, but their camp is attacked by Indians, and it seems as though they are to be \"wiped out\" by the redskins, until Sally, volunteering as a messenger, makes her way to another large camp of buffalo hunters and brings them to the rescue. In the meantime, Starlight has followed the fortunes of Sally and Tom, and it is with her aid that the massacre of the party is averted. Sally and Tom make their way at last to the gold fields where her father and mother receive her with open arms and gallant Tom is awarded the prize of her hand.",

Soon after, Simon Ingot, a wealthy tradesman, offers Garrick money to leave England, because his daughter Ada has fallen in love with the actor.

    "description": "Norma, a dancer, receives many presents from admirers. Among them she finds a peculiar looking box, out of which spring several poisonous snakes. Nelson, a detective, is called upon to solve the mystery. On the box he finds a peculiar trademark, which he seizes as a clue. At his home he finds the same odd mark on an ashtray bought by his mother in a Hindu curio shop, and he learns that the box containing the snakes was purchased by a Hindu woman. Calling upon the woman, he is surprised to find himself in the home of a Priestess of Buddhism. The Priestess tries to fascinate him with her beauty and, not succeeding, drops a powder into an incense burner, the fumes of which begin to throw him into a stupor. He fights his way to a window, blows a police whistle, and is attacked by three giant Hindu attendants. But the police arrive in time to save his life, and the Priestess is arrested and thrown into prison. The dancer, Norma, is attracted to Nelson by his bravery, and they become friends. Meanwhile, the Priestess succeeds in working a psychic miracle in which she goes into a trance and, while her earthly form remains in prison, her soul is freed and appears before the horrified detective in his study. His nature is changed immediately by the Priestess's mystic influence, and his face becomes the face of a hardened criminal. Changing his clothes for one of the rough suits used in his detective work, he visits a den of crooks and aids them to rob a bank, the plans of which he has been entrusted with in his professional capacity. Later he is called to the bank to investigate the robbery and, not knowing of his dual personality, makes every effort to find the man who had committed the crime. He finds his own scarf among the scattered papers taken from the safe. A threatening letter, which he receives from the followers of the Priestess, is seen by Norma, who is so greatly concerned for his safety that when he asks her to marry him, she quickly consents to an engagement, so that she can do all in her power to protect him. His old mother is puzzled by seeing him leave his own house through the window, when he is again visited by the spirit of the Priestess and influenced to aid the same band of crooks in the robbery of his own home. When his real personality returns, he finds himself in his own office, where he has been discovered by his mother, sleeping in a chair, dressed in his old clothes. Upon discovery that his house has been robbed, he calls the chief of police and is seen by the companions of his criminal personality, who thinks that he is acting as an agent of the authorities merely to place them in the hands of the law. When he is again transformed toy the spirit of the Priestess and returns to the thieves' den, they regard him as a spy and plan to do away with him, leaving him bound and gagged in the care of an old hag, while they celebrate his capture. But Norma, who, with his mother has been watching him, follows him to the den of thieves and, overpowering the old woman, helps him to escape. Meanwhile, the followers of the Priestess succeed in rescuing her from her prison cell and are speeding away in an automobile when Nelson, who still retains his criminal personality, asks them to assist him to escape from the crooks, who are closely upon his trail. Thus, he unwittingly places himself and his fiancée in the power of the Priestess, who makes them prisoners in a temple of Buddha. Norma faints, and when Nelson's real personality returns, he finds himself bound hand and foot in the temple. Norma quickly explains the situation to him and, by burning the ropes that bind his wrists with the fire in the incense burner, he frees his companion and makes his way to the roof by the aid of a heavy chain from which a large oriental lamp is swung from the ceiling. He succeeds in helping Norma to the roof by the same method and they reach the ground with the aid of a large tree. The chief of police, who has been summoned by Nelson's mother, overtakes the crooks and arrests them after a desperate struggle. But the Priestess cheats the majesty of the law by the aid of a poisoned ring with which she does away with herself during one of her wild fanatical dances. Her death marks the end of her influence over Nelson, and he at last feels free to marry Norma.",

The friendship of Damon, the senator, and Pythias, the soldier, is famous in Ancient Syracuse.

During the wedding ceremony for Pythias and Calanthe, Dionysius has himself proclaimed sovereign while Damon is absent from the Senate. Shocked, Damon attempts to assassinate Dionysius, but he fails and is sentenced to death. In order for Damon to say goodbye to his wife and son, Pythias leaves Calanthe and takes his friend's place in prison, offering to die in Damon's place if he does not return. Despite several tests of the strength of their friendship, they remain loyal to each other and so impress Dionysius that he allows them both Free.",

Antonio is unable to secure a woman sufficiently beautiful in body and soul to pose for the statue and loses interest in his work. He is gazing out of his studio window one sunny afternoon when his attention is attracted to a young man forcibly kissing a girl. He rushes to her aid. She is so beautiful that he begs her to pose for him. She acquiesces. From now on his work is a labor of love. He falls in love with his model and she returns his affection. One day William Baker visits Antonio's studio to learn how the statue is progressing. The model tells Antonio that Baker is the man who embraced her the afternoon he came to her rescue, so Antonio refuses to sell the statue to Baker. Antonio marries his model and a little girl blesses their union. Baker, incensed and jealous, uses his wealth to spirit away the model; he locks her in a garret in his apartment and after many weeks he wins her to himself. Meanwhile, Antonio has given up hope of ever finding his wife, and places their little daughter in a convent. From now on he becomes a wanderer and joins a band of gypsies. His wife writes him a note telling him that she is going to kill herself and explaining what Baker has done. Antonio makes efforts to save his wife from the suicide's grave but fails. Years later Antonio and Baker meet accidentally in the mountains, and in a fierce fight. Baker throws Antonio down a rocky cliff and almost kills him. The gypsies see the fight and rush to Antonio's aid. Antonio's rage against Baker becomes greater than ever, and in a frenzy he conspires with the gypsy chief to kidnap Baker's wife, swearing revenge in kind, wife for wife. The gypsy chief finds Antonio's daughter, now 17, at the same house party as Baker's wife. The chief kidnaps the daughter instead of the wife, and brings her to a hut at the gypsy camp. Antonio poisons wine that he thinks Baker's wife will drink. At the last moment he learns that it is his own daughter that he is about to kill. Frenzied, he breaks into the gypsy hut and saves her in time. He meets Baker outside the hut and begins to strangle him. His daughter begs him to leave vengeance in the hands of God; finally he accedes to her wishes. Antonio's daughter marries a young captain of the military force, who was sent to search gypsy camps and all ends happily.",

One of his pals offers to bet him $5,000 that if he will stay in New York a week he will get the thrill of his life. Steve takes the bet. Remembering that he has sold stock to Count Marinoff he wonders whether it might not be possible for him to meet the ward. The problem is solved when the Count calls Steve up and asks him to come to his home. Steve goes and meets the ward, who mystifies Steve by making mysterious signs to him. The Count informs Steve that the girl is crazy. The girl's maid passes Steve a note that says the girl is in great peril and wants him to help her. The Count being called away, the maid directs Steve to go up to the second floor. Ascending the stairs he drops through a trap door on the landing and is bound and gagged by the Count's butler, but the maid releases him, and he telephones to the boys at the club and asks some of them to come out to the Count's house. The boys come, and a battle follows between the Count and his servants on one side, Steve and the clubmen on the other. Steve battles up through the house to the roof with one of the Count's henchmen, who has carried the ward off in his arms early in the conflict. After finally knocking the villain cold Steve searches for the girl but cannot find her. All the men who have been fighting, both his friends and the Count have mysteriously disappeared. As he is at his wits end he sees the face of the butler peeping through a sliding panel in the wall. The panel quickly closes and Steve kicks his way through it and finds himself in a banquet hall where the whole company of his friends and supposed foes are dining together, the persecuted ward beaming at him from the end of the table. The friend with whom Steve made the bet now explains that he has been given the promised thrill, the members of the party, except the clubmen, being members of the theatrical profession, especially engaged for the doings. Just then there arrives four of Steve's cowboys, for whom he telephoned at the same time that he telephoned the club. With their aid Steve quickly turns the tables on the jokers. While cowboys cover the party with their guns Steve announces that he, like Lochinvar, came out of the West, grabs the girl, and rides away with her. She is a not-unwilling captive, and as hour later the weary party still held under the guns get a wireless from Steve that he is quite willing to pay his bet; he has had the thrill of his life, for he is married and sailing away on his wedding tour.",

He disgraces his family by his devotion to her, and, lured on by her demands, abandons his promising career. Stephen Wayne, meeting her in an endeavor to compel her to release Anthony from his unfortunate entanglement, falls sincerely in love with her and she with him. Later, with the dawning of this first real love of her life. Marcia renounces her butterfly life and becomes a tender and self-sacrificing woman. She returns all of Anthony's gifts, giving them to Stephen for safe keeping. In order to disillusion Anthony she causes him to believe she is only a common woman and he turns from her in disgust. Led on by Eric Mainwaring, an actor in love with Marcia, who tells Anthony that Marcia is a woman to be bought and not loved, Anthony is persuaded to steal from his father's safe government funds placed there by Stephen, and is cheated of the money at cards by Eric. Stephen, discovering the theft, goes to Marcia's apartment to confront her with the result of her influence over Anthony, and is there in time to rescue her from Eric, who comes with the money he has cheated from Anthony, to persuade Marcia to go abroad with him. Stephen forces Eric to disgorge the stolen funds and to leave in fear o£ the authorities. The following morning Anthony, penniless, an outcast and a thief, is saved from committing suicide by Doris. His father discovering the theft and accusing Anthony, urges him on to suicide, telling his son that honorable death is better than a life of dishonor. Stephen arrives with Marcia in time to avert the tragedy, telling a lie to save Anthony in the eyes of his father and Doris, that it was he (Stephen) who took the money from the safe, at the same time producing the bills to substantiate his claim. A general reconciliation follows. When his father sees Marcia standing beside Stephen he fears that this other son has been ensnared, but Stephen tells them that they have all misjudged her, and that she is going to enhance the family honor by becoming his wife.",

He now goes to Lost Lake for recreation. Because the hotel accommodations are insufficient, Abner Clark takes Vaughan to his home, where in daily association with Jude the childhood friendship is renewed, and it gradually intensifies. Judge West, sensing the trend of events, charges Vaughan with \"trifling\" and reminds him that Jude is engaged to marry Dave Bean, a man of her own style. Harrison has induced Jude to pose for him, promising payment of $50 for the service, but the completed picture shows Jude in a pose she had never assumed. When Vaughan sees the picture, the opinion he has formed of the mountain girl suddenly changes. Several of the gossips get a view of the canvas and Harrison says he understood that Jude posed exactly as she was painted. Jude spurned the artist's $50 when she discovered the trick he played upon her, but when her father falls ill and needed hospital attention,, she pockets her pride and calls to get the cash. While she's at Harrison's camp Dave Bean, guided by the village gossips, enters and accuses her of lax morality, punishes the artists, and declares that the mountain girl shall never become Mrs. Bean. When Abner Clark dies, Jude is left without a protector or means of support, but Judge West intercepts her as she is about to leave Lost Lake and installs her at his own camp as full partner with him in his gold prospecting. Vaughan had left Lost Lake heartbroken because he believed ill of Jude. Months later, he writes to Jude that he has reconsidered and asks her to invite him to return. Jude's eager answer is unhappily stowed in Judge West's pocket for an indefinite time, and it is not until they strike gold that the missive is accidentally revealed. Discovery of the letter leads to a speedy understanding.",

During one such hypnotic session, Sumadya becomes a conduit for Rajini, a renowned actress from the past who lived five decades ago. This extraordinary connection allows Rajini to communicate with Warenya, who resides in the year 2020, from her living self in the 1960s.

As their affection deepens, complications arise as the love between Warenya and Rajini relies on Sumadya remaining a conduit.

They follow him in the hope they will be led to the headquarters of the international band, who they feel sure are back of the traffic. The Chinaman fails to pay on time for the last supply he has received, and in turn the New York distributor is unable to send the money to the headquarters of the gang. This brings the chief to New York to investigate. While there he visits his broker, John Maxwell. He intends his visit to be secret, but is seen by one of the stenographers. This incenses him and angry words pass. In the meantime the Chinaman comes to the office and pays his bill. As the clerk is making out the receipt the detectives raid the place and find the dead body of the broker. All suspicion points to the clerk, who is accused of the murder of his employer. He is taken away by one of the detectives, but makes his escape. He goes to the North Country, makes application to join the Boundary Riders, and after a probation is accepted as an agent of law and order. On one of his patrols he finds a note that gives him a clue to the headquarters of the opium smugglers. The detective from the New York office of the Revenue Service comes to the camp of the riders to continue his investigations. There he recognizes the clerk. The clerk employs a clever woman investigator, who in guise of a Chinaman gets employment as a cook at the smugglers' headquarters. With the information she secures, he leads the revenue men to the headquarters of the gang. The raid is successful, but as all are congratulating the new member on his success the detective steps up and arrests him on the charge of murdering his employer. The investigator, however, has done her work well and produces a coat belonging to the head smuggler from which are torn two pieces which exactly match two pieces of cloth found in the hand of the dead man. This exonerates the clerk and puts added power in the hands of the government men.",

    "description": "When John Storey died suddenly in India, his daughter, Helen, an only child, became heiress to his estate, worth some £20,000. Although Helen was nearly of age, she knew practically nothing of the world and less about her father's affairs. News of Storey's demise reached his agent in England, Mr. Henry Murdoch, at a time when that gentleman was in deep financial distress. Holding full power of attorney over Storey's investments, he was tempted by a suggestion from his worthless and rascally nephew to take advantage of Helen's ignorance, and for the time being to make use of the Storey money to pull himself out of the mire. To avoid danger of detection the nephew further suggested destroying a letter from Storey, which would have served not only as a will, but would be the only document which could incriminate Murdoch in the event of his carrying out his intentions. Watching his chance, the nephew secretly pocketed the letter and burned a blank sheet of paper in its stead. The ashes completely deceived Murdoch, who fell easily into the trap, thereby putting himself entirely into the hands of his unscrupulous nephew. Helen came to live in the Murdoch household, but after months of grieving, her health was becoming undermined, and Murdoch, acting on his nephew's advice, sent Helen into the country, accompanied by the housekeeper. This change was very acceptable to Helen, principally because the nephew insisted in paying her most unpleasant lover-like attentions. The country air did wonders for Helen, but the thing which hastened her recovery more than anything else was her happiness in winning the love of Lionel Maun. All went smoothly until the housekeeper wrote to Murdoch of Helen's love affair. Again the nephew influenced Murdoch by pointing out the possibility of prison in case Helen married some clever young man who might investigate her affairs for her. The only safe course that Murdoch could see to follow was to marry Helen himself, and to that end he ordered her home at once. One day Lionel called to see Helen, but Murdoch, driven by fear and jealousy, grossly insulted him and ordered him off the premises. By the time Lionel reached the station he was impelled by fear for Helen, at the mercy of an apparent madman, to return. Meanwhile Murdoch brought matters to a crisis by trying to force Helen to submit to his loathsome lovemaking, but the nephew's arrival on the scene saved her from his persecution. Murdoch, thoroughly enraged, was in no mood to listen to a demand for money, and when the nephew threatened to make use of the letter written by Storey to compel him to give in, Murdoch endeavored to force him to give up the letter by attacking him with a dagger-like bill file. Their fighting attracted the butler, who arrived at the door in time to see the nephew give his uncle a fatal thrust. The sudden shock completely unhinged the butler's mind and he fell unconscious to the floor. Helen also heard the noise and came into the room at the moment Lionel stepped through the French window left open by the escaping nephew. Under the circumstances each thought the other guilty of the tragic deed and, before they had time to explain, the housekeeper entered the room. Lionel, seeking to protect Helen, ordered her not to say a word to anyone, which appeared on the face of things to be an admission of guilt on his part. At the trial, Lionel, still endeavoring to defend Helen, made no defense and was consequently convicted and sentenced to death. As he stood to receive his sentence, Helen realized his innocence, and to the consternation of everyone in court, she obeyed a sudden impulse and convinced them all that she had committed the crime herself. The night before her execution, the butler, now sufficiently recovered to be allowed the freedom of the sanatorium to which he had been sent, read an account of Helen's sensational confession at the trial. Horrified, he tries to explain the awful mistake, but, of course, was not believed. At a late hour that evening he escaped from the sanatorium and reached the house of the defending counsel, where he found Lionel. Realizing the only chance of obtaining a reprieve lay in surprising the nephew into an admission of guilt, they went to the Murdoch home and by a clever ruse succeeded in accomplishing their errand. A desperate fight ensued and the nephew was taken prisoner. Then, armed with a reprieve signed by the Home Secretary, they arrived at the goal just in time to prevent a most serious miscarriage of justice.",

    "description": "When the story opens Sylvia Lacey has been left an orphan. Her shiftless father, Sam Lacey, of artistic, but weak nature, left her without money. Her mother had died ten years before. The girl writes to her only remaining relatives, an aunt, Miss Martha Lacey, and her mother's brother. In his youth the Judge, Calvin Trent, wanted to marry Miss Martha, but they quarreled. When Sylvia's letter arrives, announcing that she will be in Boston the next day, both uncle and aunt are nonplussed. Neither wants the responsibility. Miss Martha finally decides to go and the Judge sends his young partner, John Dunham, in his place. Miss Martha waits with the young lawyer in the hotel parlor. Plainly she speaks her mind to John about the inconveniences of the girl's coming. Sylvia is already in the room and hears. She promptly refuses any aid from either relatives. Miss Martha is sorry, but it is too late. Dunham, however, goes back to the girl and forces her to accept a loan (of judge's money.) Back in the village, Miss Martha and the Judge both remember a cousin of the Judge's who manages the Judge's main farm. \"Thinkright\" is sent for and his white hair and kindly eyes soon win the girl to visit him. \"Thinkright\" once loved Sylvia's mother and is naturally drawn toward the girl. As she and \"Thinkright\" reach the Mill Farm near Portland, she sees the deserted old Tide Mill with all its shutters closed. Imaginative, she says then and always after, that the old mill is sorrowing and only love can open the shutters. Edna Derwent, a rich Boston girl, who owns a cottage on a nearby island, is a friend and disciple of \"Thinkright's.\" He has taught her to be patient with the false social life which means so much to her mother. Each summer she comes to Hawk Island with Miss Lacey as chaperon. Sylvia becomes jealous of Edna and all her beauty, charm and wealth. \"Thinkright\" stops this trend of thought in the girl and after several severe tussles, turns her thoughts into the right road. She struggles bravely. Her uncle, penitent, arrives and promptly falls in love with this niece he has never seen before. She forgives him. The next day Miss Lacey arrives at Hawk Island with Edna. This forgiveness is harder, but Sylvia, strong in her new right thinking, manages it. She is invited to the Derwent cottage for a visit. John Dunham, an old friend of Edna's, comes for a visit and his fancy is quickly taken with the imaginative Sylvia whom he rescued in Boston the month before. Sylvia has a strong talent for painting. She has done some things with pencil, but longs for paint. She has no money and is too proud to ask any of her relatives. In her heart she adores John Dunham, but has held herself coldly toward him because she thought that he and Edna were engaged. Suddenly she discovers that he loves her. In her embarrassment she drops her book of sketches and \"Thinkright'' finds pieces of brown paper covered with drawings, all showing much power and talent. Edna leagues Judge Trent in a plan, and Sylvia learns that she is to have lessons in painting. The winter passes. Sylvia is making rapid strides in her profession under Edna's special wing in Boston. Summer comes and she goes to the Mill Farm again for a visit. Walking alone on the edge of the basin, she sees the shutters of the Tide Mill have opened and the windows are gleaming brightly. Just then John Dunham appears and asks her to go with him to the Tide Mill. It is open. The first floor is vacant and so is the second. He asks her to go clear to the top and there she finds a luxuriantly appointed artist's studio. \"Love opened the shutters,\" says John, \"I bought the Mill and furnished this for my bride.\" The old story is told and the shutters of life open wide for the girl who learned to think right.",

    "description": "The allegory which begins the story represents the world before the creation of man. Out of the elements is born Conscience. Conscience is then present at the fall of the first parents, and drives them from the garden. Conscience is again present when Moses breaks the tablets of stone in his anger at the Israelites for their idolatry on Sinai. At last Conscience sustains the Christ when He stands on trial before the Roman Governor of Judea, Pontius Pilate. Then begins the story. A child is born, bearing the name of John Conscience. The figure of the allegory is seen to touch the newborn babe, and it is fore-ordained that he is to be a creature of Conscience. The child grows to manhood. He holds the chair in economics in a great university, and is delivering an exhortation to the graduating class. He tells the young men of some of the shameful conditions the wealthy employer class is imposing upon the poor and helpless class. He bids them go forth with conscience to guide their careers, and that they will be successful in the real sense. The wealthy men, trustees of the university, etc., who are in audience, disagree with John Conscience's principles to such an extent that they demand his resignation, as the result of the speech. One of them, however, Stephen Might, whose son Stephen Might. Jr., is among the students, feels that John Conscience will be a great success in some business where the question of conscience will not be raised, and tells him that he will have a position for him whenever be may want it. John Conscience, sustained by the encouragement of his mother, tries in various fields, without success. He happens to see a girl who is about to end her efforts to succeed and still remain good, by plunging into the river. He dissuades her and takes her to his mother. She tells her story, how she had left her father's roof to earn her living and be useful in the world, and the mother advises her to go back to her father. John is inspired with new hope after his good deed, goes to Stephen Might, obtains a position for himself, and also one for the girl. He rises in position with this concern, and a love affair develops between them, but Stephen Might, Jr., also falls in love with the girl. At a time when a rival company is trying to bribe John Conscience to divulge secrets which will mean the undoing of Might and Company, John Conscience comes upon Mary Knowles, the girl, in the arms of Stephen, and thinks she has accepted him. His mistake causes him to throw off conscience, and begin a grinding, resolute, uncompromising drive for wealth. In Chicago John Conscience takes the name of John Power. He comes to the control of great interests, owns factories, and rules over all these interests with a hand of iron. His employees are but mechanical parts of his structure, and he has no soul, no heart. When the girl realizes what he had meant to her, she denounces Might, Jr., and her father, who had helped about the situation, and runs away. At the time Power's success is at its zenith she us a stenographer in one of his factories. At this time also, in his determination to avenge himself upon Stephen Might, Jr. he is using unfair business methods to drive the Might concern to the wall. Young Might learns that it is the Power firm which is oppressing them and goes to see Power, not knowing who he is. He arrives, and as John is about to drive home his revenge, Stephen tells h him of a mistake, that he thought Mary was with him, as she ran away the same night he had disappeared. John has been harassed by the public safety committees about the unsanitary conditions and lark of safety in his factories, and has been obdurate and unresponsive. Now, he sees that he was wrong, experiences a faint hope, and tells Might he will let him know the next day what can be done. He goes home, and sits by the fireplace in his library to think. Conscience appears to him again, and shows him, by a series of contrasts, the difference between the power he has achieved over the financial world and that which Conscience wields over the souls of men. He is receptive, and Conscience again enters his soul. He calls for architects and builders to reconstruct his factories, for the safety of his employees, and before they can begin work a great fire breaks out in one of his factories, and Mary is caught in an upper story. John rides to the scene, and sees her at a window. He rescues her and their romance finds its proper conclusion.",

Judas, eager for revenge, plans to substitute her baby for the Courtland infant, confident that she can carry out her scheme as the babies bear a striking resemblance to each other. The change of babies is successfully made. A few years elapse and Pearl, Byke's daughter is raised as Courtland's, while Laura, the Courtland child, is brought up as Byke's daughter and taught to steal. Laura is caught stealing by her own father and mother, the Courtlands. Laura's tale of how her \"papa\" makes her steal touches the Courtlands and they adopt her (their own child) after making a money settlement with Byke. Laura and Pearl are about 20 when the Courtlands die, leaving their fortune equally divided between the two girls. Pearl is secretly in love with Ray Trafford, Laura's suitor. Byke plans to blackmail Laura and gets Snorky, an ex-soldier to deliver her the following note: \"My darling daughter, I think it's about time you had a talk with me. I am outside waiting to see you. Your own father. Wm. Byke\" Laura faints and Pearl reads the note. Byke enters the house but is thrown out by Ray. Pearl tells Ray Laura's story and hands him the note Ray gives vent to his shocked feelings and Laura interprets his action to mean that he is ashamed of her. Laura takes off her engagement ring and goes to her room. Through the prevarications of Pearl, Laura is led to believe that Ray does not care to see her again, and Ray likewise believes that his dismissal is final. Ray writes Laura that he loves her although her parents are of low origin. Through Pearl's craftiness this note is never delivered to Laura. Byke and Judas attempt to kill Blossom, as she knows the truth about Laura and Pearl, but they are frustrated by Snorky. At the Rensaeller reception, Pearl plans Laura's disgrace. She drops Ray's note to Laura, which is found by Mrs. Rensaeller, whereupon Laura is snubbed by all. Humiliated, Laura goes away, leaving a note saying that her share of the estate goes to Pearl. Ray at once begins a search for Laura and engages Snorky to assist. Byke and Judas, seeking to obtain hush-money from Laura find Laura's note, stating that she leaves her money to Pearl. They discover Laura's lodging-house and abduct her. Laura is taken to Byke's den on the riverfront. Unless Laura agrees to sign over her fortune, her chances of living are dubious. Blossom discovers Laura's plight and notifies Snorky. Through Snorky, Laura is saved, but Snorky is caught by Byke. Snorky, firmly bound to the piling and left to drown by inches, is rescued by Ray and Blossom. Laura, escaping across the river, is found by Snorky. She seeks safety in a tool house by the railroad track. Snorky is again caught by Byke and bound to the track, and left to his fate. Laura, observing, is frantic when she finds the tool house door locked. With the aid of an axe, she breaks open the door and reaches Snorky just in time to save him from certain death, as the train is bearing down upon him. Byke and Judas go to Pearl at the Courtland's summer home and Judas tells Pearl she is her mother. Pearl realizes the bitter truth of her parentage when Blossom confirms Judas' assertion. Pearl upbraids Judas and turns her from the house. Snorky brings Laura to Ray at the Courtland home, where they meet Byke. Snorty shoots Byke, who staggers out and falls dead at the feet of Judas. Judas, widowed and disowned by her daughter, leaves in despair. Pearl confesses that she and not Laura is the daughter of Judas and Byke and begs Laura's forgiveness for the wrong she has done, which Laura in her newfound happiness readily grants.",

Portia's father has died and left a very strange will: only the man that picks the correct casket out of three (silver, gold, and lead) can marry her. Bassanio, unfortunately, is strapped for cash with which to go wooing, and Antonio wants to help, so Antonio borrows the money from Shylock, the money-lender. But Shylock has been nursing a grudge against Antonio's insults, and makes unusual terms to the loan. And when Antonio's business fails, those terms threaten his life, and it's up to Bassanio and Portia to save him.",

    "description": "Kate Clarke and her brother, Joe, are alone in the world. Kate learns of her brother's connection with a counterfeiter's gang only when the police invade their rooms to arrest Joe. After a desperate struggle, Joe escapes, but Kate is seriously injured by an accidental blow. She recovers, but the memory of her past is gone. Kate wanders away to the city and becomes a cabaret dancer. Richard Harris, a noted artist, has a vision of creating a \"Madonna,\" but has been unable to secure a suitable model. While visiting the cabaret, he sees in Kate the model he seeks and she consents to pose for the painting. As the painting progresses, Harris' interest ripens into love, but this only amuses her. At length, bored by posing, she suddenly goes away. The painting is yet unfinished. Harris, heartbroken over his loss, pours out the whole story in a letter to his twin brother, Joseph, a minister. Meanwhile the train which Kate had taken is wrecked near the village where Harris' brother is both pastor and physician to his flock. Interested in Kate's peculiar case, he has removed her to his home. The shock has blotted out entirely the memory of the past few years of her life as a dancer, nor does she remember how she came to be aboard the train. She recalls only her life before her first injury. The artist meanwhile has made futile attempts to finish his \"Madonna.\" Broken in health and despondent he sends for his brother. One day, in his delirium, seeing Kate before his eyes, he finishes the painting. The brother arrives too late, but recognizing Kate as the original of the \"Madonna\" he takes it back home and hangs it in the church. During the minister's absence, Jane Perkins, one of his parishioners who is jealous of his attentions to Kate, finds the letter which the artist has written to his brother. She reads it and learns the tragic story of the artist and the girl who posed for the picture, the \"Madonna.\" Kate's brother, Joe, unrepentant, is still a counterfeiter and a member of a gang located near this village. Kate and Joe meet, but he begs her not to disclose his identity or whereabouts. Unfortunately, Jane sees the affectionate parting and straightway starts a scandal. A bazaar fete is in progress in the church rooms, and while some of the congregation are admiring the \"Madonna,\" Jane discloses Kate's past, and thus for the first time the girl, who overhears it, cruelly learns the story of her lost few years. The church members turn against her, but the minister defends her. By impersonating one of the members of the church, Fagin, a detective, captures all of the gang except Joe, who takes refuge in the church. He is tracked there and accidentally upsets a small stove, setting fire to the church. Badly injured, Joe crawls to the place where his sister is now living. The minister rescues Kate. The \"Madonna\" is practically the only article which escapes the flames. Kate, returning home, finds Joe. His condition requiring medical attention, she summons the minister, who remains through the night with Joe. Pledged to keep Joe's presence a secret, the minister is unable to answer the elder's demand for explanations. Joe dies and the gossiping villagers soon learn the truth. The minister presents the \"Madonna\"' to a Metropolitan Art Gallery where the public flock to see it. Though they may not know it, they are looking at the perfect likeness of the minister's present wife and child.",

    "description": "Filled with memories of the Philippine campaign, Lieutenant Ranson returns to the United States. After a month or two in Washington, he tells his father that he must have a change, and a chance to see some excitement. General Ranson writes and arranges to have him go to Fort Stanton, Texas, an Army post commanded by an old friend. Arrived at the railroad town nearest to the post, Ranson is conveyed to the post by stagecoach. A prairie fire is in progress a few miles away from Fort Stanton, and Ranson joins the soldiers and others in fighting it. Incidentally, he is successful in rescuing Mary Cahill, the daughter of the post-trader, Patrick Cahill. Ranson is received into the life of the fort and becomes a leader among the younger men. Ranson talks of the \"big doings\" out in the Philippines, and is \"bored to death\" with the dull routine of the fort. When one of the men calls his attention to a placard announcing a large reward for the capture of \"The Red Rider,\" Ranson declares that it is nothing at all to hold up a stage; that anyone can do it and get away with it; that on a $50 bet, he himself, will hold up the stagecoach that night with a pair of shears. His brother officers ridicule the idea. Ranson insists that he can, and will, do it. Meantime, at the railway town, the coach has already started when Lieutenant Patten, the paymaster, arrives, carrying a bag containing $10.000 with which to pay off the soldiers. Finding the coach gone, he engages a man with a buckboard to drive him to the fort. Ranson successfully holds up the stagecoach. He is polite to the two lady passengers and takes nothing from anybody except a souvenir from one of the ladies, in the form of her photograph, this being sufficient proof to show his brother officers. He then rides back to the post. Meantime, Lieutenant Patten, hurrying along in the buckboard, is held up by a masked man dressed almost exactly as was Ranson. In a fight that ensues, the highwayman shoots and kills the driver of the buckboard, and wounds the lieutenant in the shoulder. The robber then gets possession of the bag of money and makes good his escape, but not before he has been himself shot in the hand by the paymaster. At the post, the news of the robbery arrives with the return of the detachment of men who have been sent out to escort the paymaster. They bring Lieutenant Patten with them, and he tells of the robbery and of having wounded the robber in the hand. As an outcome of the whole affair, Ranson is arrested, charged with having held up both stage and the pay-train. He is confined to his quarters, awaiting court martial, and there he sends for Mr. Cahill, with whom he wishes to speak in regard to Mary. He notices that Cabin's hand is bandaged, but Cahill tells him that his pony bit him while he was bridling her. Mary enters, and in the course of the conversation tells Ranson that her father has told her that he shot himself in the hand while fooling with his revolver. Ranson is at once suspicious, and when Mary goes out he accuses Cahill of being the real \"Red Rider.\" Finally Cahill confesses that it is true. Ranson tells him that no matter what happened, he will stick by his daughter. He urges Cahill to hurry away to Fort Worth on the pretext of buying an engagement ring. Cahill says he will do so and that he will write a letter of confession exonerating Ranson, after he is safely in Canada. But hardly has he entered the other room when Ranson hears a shot. Rushing in, he finds Cahill lying across the table, a bullet through his brain. By his hand is a brief note of confession, which he has hastily scribbled. As Mary rushes in, Ranson draws her back but she has guessed the truth. Her father has paid for his long-concealed life of crime, and now she gives herself wholly into Ranson's keeping, knowing that her father's wish was to have them marry and be happy.",

We were fortunate enough to capture every second of this journey: his preparations for each run, how he deals with certain obstacles (weather, authorities, traffic), his raw fear of death/severe injury, his relationships within the downhill community, and most importantly we got to know Nick for the kind, thoughtful, passionate young man he is.",

One night in a restaurant, a pretty waitress seeing that he is intoxicated, refuses to wait upon him; he insults her and is requested to leave. Next day he goes back to apologize and the two become friends and eventually get married. Howard's father, who for some years had been a widower, marries again, the lady being an old friend and patron of Bob Underwood. Eventually the two boys leave college; the young artist establishes a studio and quotes Mrs. Jefferies Sr.'s name as a patron to induce an advantage. The lady, however, withdraws her patronage and Underwood finds himself broke. On Howard informing his father of his marriage to a pretty waitress, the father turns him adrift and cuts off all allowance. Both Howard and Annie seek work, but find nothing but discouragement. Underwood not being able to borrow any more money from Howard, makes a last desperate appeal to the elder Mrs. Jefferies, informing her that he contemplates suicide. One night Howard much intoxicated enters Underwood's studio and lying down on the sofa falls asleep. Bob finds him and places a screen around the couch. Shortly after Mrs. Jefferies Sr. enters. Not seeing Howard, she has an interview with Underwood and refuses him any monetary assistance or further influence and leaves, declaring their association at an end. Robert then enters his sleeping room and placing a revolver at his head, fires. His bell boy raises an alarm, the police arrive and find young Howard leaning over the dead man's body. He is placed under arrest and on the spot Captain Clinton in the presence of others, puts him through the third degree. The terrible ordeal lasts for hours until the boy hypnotized and overcome with fright and need of rest, confesses that he had killed his friend. Howard is thrown into jail and his father unrelenting not only refuses aid, but instructs his own lawyer that the boy is a murderer and he must suffer, also that if the eminent attorney takes the case, that he must not look for any more of the Jefferies' patronage. Aside from the false confession wrung from the boy, the only clue to the mystery is the fact that a woman visited the studio on the night of the tragedy. Howard's young wife after much endeavor induces Mr. Brewster, the corporation lawyer, to take the case in defiance of Jefferies' orders. At the trial Mr. Brewster introduces Dr. Bernstein, an expert on hypnotism, who rigorously confounded the police captain who had extorted the false confession. Both Mrs. Howard Jefferies, Sr., and Mrs. Howard, Jr., were at the trial and under the terrible pressure of the scene Mrs. Jefferies, Sr., produced the letter that Underwood had written to her, threatening suicide. The letter was simply addressed to Mrs. Howard Jefferies and to save the elder lady's good name, Annie, the young wife of Howard, claimed that the letter was sent to her and that it was she who visited the studio on the eventful night. The case was dismissed and Attorney Brewster, by his good offices, brought Howard's father to the young folks' humble lodging and effected a reconciliation and happiness for all.",

    "description": "Prologue: John J. Haggleton is the oil king of the world. In his first years while fighting bitterly for success his methods are unscrupulous. His wife suffers as a result and learns to hate his dishonesty. One day, finding written proof of a plot to burn up the oil refinery of a competitor, she leaves him, taking her baby boy and the condemning documents. Lawrence, a competitor of Haggleton, shoots himself as a result of Haggleton's manipulations and another, Moran, ruined, falls into misery. Haggleton's wife dies in poverty, leaving her boy, Philip, in the care of a poor old man named Gentle, who brings him up under an assumed name so that the boy shall never know his father's name. Gentle keeps the documents incriminating Haggleton. The story proper opens in Moran's home. Moran, who is now working in a miserable East Side bakery with his daughter, Jenny, a woman of the streets who has been ruined by Lawrence's son, but who has reformed, is in love with Philip Ames, who is really the son of Haggleton. He in turn is in love, not with Jenny, but with Margaret Lawrence, daughter of the man who committed suicide. She is a nurse in a hospital. Haggleton comes to visit the tenement in which the Morans live and there meets his son, who is calling on Moran. Haggleton does not reveal his identity. He discovers through Gentle the identity of his son and of the hatred his son has been taught to bear against the oil king. Haggleton is struck by the boy's speeches and when shown the horrible conditions of the people living in the tenement, he offers to help them with money, but his son refuses the money, saying that a man in order to make charity effective must not merely hand money to poor people but must understand them as well. Haggleton, in an effort to win back his son, decides to try living as a laborer. He sends orders for his yacht to sail, spreading the rumor that he is on board for a long cruise. Then he starts life over in a tenement without a penny. Haggleton starts work as a kneader in Moran's bake-shop and after studying conditions begins to build up an electrical bakeshop, which will later become a real bread trust. As they prosper, the home of Moran becomes happier, but Moran, inflamed by socialistic ideas, spread about by a few bakers who are thrown out of work by the electrical machinery, nurses anarchistic hatred against men such as Haggleton who ruined him. He doesn't know, however, that Jackson is Haggleton. To this argument Haggleton explains to him that his bread trust may be hurting a few bakers, but benefits the whole East Side. Haggleton learns of the engagement of Philip with Margaret Lawrence. He tries to withhold this marriage as he has much greater plans in mind for his son, and in so doing discloses his real identity. Moran, infuriated, tries to shoot Haggleton, but Philip, who has learned to love him in the past months, stands between Moran and his father and receives the shot. He is taken to the Haggleton home on Fifth Avenue and nursed there by Margaret Lawrence. When his health is restored, Margaret announces her intention of leaving the house, for she thinks she can never bear to marry a son of the man who ruined her father.

    "description": "Amy Cary, owner of a controlling interest in the Peoples Gas Company, of which her uncle, Peter Cary, is president, is practical but sentimental. It is indefinitely understood that she is engaged to marry Norman Van Aulsten, whose intriguing father is vice-president of the company. Van Aulsten, Sr., has secretly purchased worthless Suburban Lighting Company stock and plans to unload it at an exorbitant price on the People's Gas Company, depending on his son to induce Amy to vote approval of his plan. Amy goes to Trout Lake Camp to spend the summer, where she meets a chum, Helen Nelson, who invites her brother Bob, a young attorney, to join her. Young Van Aulsten also is a visitor, paying considerable attention to Amy Cary, but clandestinely making love to, and deceiving to the point of defiling, the daughter of Johnson, the camp guide. Amy's uncle, innocently falling into Van Aulsten's scheme to unload the worthless lighting company stock on the People's Gas Company, writes, asking Amy her opinion regarding it. Her reply brings him to the camp also, where he is quickly followed by Van Aulsten, Sr. Nelson fathoms Van Aulsten's intentions regarding the worthless stock, and also sees that Van Aulsten is depending on his son's marriage to Amy to further his machinations. He invokes the aid of his sister's sweetheart, who invites Amy to go for a row with him. She steps into the boat, Nelson quickly follows, leaving his willing friend ashore. Nelson talks plainly to Amy, telling her he is taking her to her uncle who has gone to a nearby island for a fishing trip, and that he purposes telling her uncle about Van Aulsten's scheme. He apparently arouses her ire by advising her not to marry young Van Aulsten. Arrived at the island they are surprised not to find Amy's uncle, who had returned to the camp for forgotten fishing tackle. The situation is tense when they discover that their boat has gone adrift. Meanwhile Amy's absence has occasioned alarm, and when Bob's friend tells of the proposed trip to the island, a rescue party is made up of Amy's uncle, Van Aulsten and his son. Arrived there they find Amy and Bob trying to prepare a belated meal. Nelson is asked to leave while her uncle and Van Aulsten urge Amy to get ready to got at once with them to the city, where a meeting of the Gas Company stockholders is scheduled the next day. Bob suspects their intentions, and promptly sets their boat adrift also. When this is discovered, there is general indignation in which Amy apparently joins. Bob is berated, but excites Amy's sentimental nature again when he takes to the water for a long, perilous swim, in an attempt to recover their boat. \"Isn't he a hero?\" she asks of young Van Aulsten. \"I'd like to see you do anything as brave as that.\" The marooned party is finally rescued by Bob's relief expeditions and taken back to the camp, where, as they land, Johnson the guide, attempts to shoot young Van Aulsten. Amy prevents the tragedy, but scorns young Van Aulsten when she learns of his behavior toward Johnson's daughter. In rapid sequence, a happy termination of the situation is reached, but the bankrupt lighting company's stock is still on the market.",

    "description": "Tom Grayson, an engineer employed in Mexico, quarrels with some Greasers. When they plot to kill him, the plan is overheard by Lake, a promoter of worthless mines who scents an opportunity to make himself solid with the engineer. Accordingly the authorities are informed, and Tom is saved and Lake thereby wins Tom's friendship and regard. Back in the New England village, Judge Grayson, his wife, and their adopted daughter Cecelia make things as pleasant as possible for the little woman next door, who is socially ostracized by the village gossips because nothing is known of her former life and associates. When his work in Mexico is finished Tom returns home and thus meets the woman next door. Lake, hoping to obtain Tom's endorsement in a fraudulent mining venture, visits the Grayson's and one day is introduced to \"Miss Ferguson.\" He acknowledges the introduction with a \"Hello, Jenny.\" The little woman at first denies her identity and then finally admits that she is Jenny Gay, the former actress whose celebrated divorce suit was dragged through the mire of the yellow journals the year before. Tom, however, refuses to lose faith in her and she tells him her unfortunate history; how, when she was starring on Broadway, Lake had been an ardent suitor and had made life miserable with his persecutions. To escape him she married Ben Whittier, a wealthy banker, but found no happiness in the union, owing to her husband's fondness for Lake and his readiness to believe Lake's lies about her. Then Jenny told him of that night in the big hotel which formed the basis of Whittier's divorce proceedings; of how she had returned about midnight and gone to her room when Lake, who was secreted in a closet, suddenly stepped out. Before she could break from his grasp the door was pushed open and Whittier, with two detectives rushed in. After the sensational divorce, Jenny went to this quiet Connecticut town to seek peace and seclusion. At the conclusion of her narrative, they agree that the only thing to do is to wring a confession from Lake. This they plan to do. In the meantime, Tom's father, a retired lawyer, suspects Lake. With the aid of Federal authorities he is able to do this and on the day set, two secret service men arrive. That afternoon Jenny writes a note to Lake telling him that she has changed her mind about marrying him. Tom, Mr. Grayson and the detectives are hid in Jenny's house and, at the proper moment. Tom comes out and forces from Lake a statement of the framed-up divorce. When this is published, the announcement of the coming marriage of Tom Grayson and \"the woman next door\" is announced.",

    "description": "Mary Ellen McKay, a country girl, comes to New York to become a singer. She stops at a furnished room house, and expends her savings on useless lessons, for her voice is only mediocre. Harry Weatherby is a disappointment of his millionaire father, who hopes to make him a captain of industry. Instead, Harry is a ne'er-do-well. While visiting Dr. Cameron, a friend of the family, he sees Mary Ellen across the way, and a flirtation starts. It eventually results in marriage. Harry is afraid to break the news to his stern father; his mother does, and he does. Enraged, Weatherby visits Mary and tries to buy her off. But she spurns his money, and he changes his tactics. He tells her he likes her, that he will give a party in honor of the marriage. He enlists the aid of Silk Harrington, who brings along a number of his smart tenderloin friends who pass themselves off as society. They influence her to drink, and soon she is acting very foolish. Harry arrives, sees her condition, and denounces her, thinking this is her true self. Harry's father leaves her a check for $10,000 before he goes, if she will promise never to see Harry again. She crumples the check in her hand, when the truth dawns upon her, and it is later picked up by Silk Harrington, who plans to use it. Mary goes home, thoroughly crushed and humiliated. She tries to commit suicide, but a friend. Kate Weld, a trained nurse, who lives across the hall, and Dr. Cameron save her life. Learning she is a stranger in New York, Dr. Cameron takes her to his country home to recuperate. Harry plunges into business to forget, and his father is happy. Mary recovers her health, but her faith is shattered. She wants to go out into the world now and have a good time. Dr. Cameron argues in vain. He decides to take her sightseeing. First he takes her to Cherry's, then to the Haymarket, where she sees the broken-down men and women. He tells her that is the price that must be paid. Lastly he takes her to his mission on the East Side. Here he tells her a story. He, too, was in love and lost. He tried everything in his pursuit of forgetfulness, and finally discovered solace for his sorrow in brightening the lives of others. Mary tells him she, too, wants to do this work. Meanwhile Harrington tries to pass the check. Harry is summoned to the bank and learns the truth through Harrington. He goes home and a big scene follows between him and his father. He eventually locates Mary. At first she does not want to forgive him, but she finally capitulates.",

Unknown to her husband, her mother, Mrs. Brunschaut, has involved her in a foreign conspiracy, in order that she may add to the extravagance of her living. David Angelo becomes aware of the intrigue, but before he can discover just what it is, he is called to Naples on business. He leaves his fortune in care of his partner, Stroggi, to be given to Mrs. Angelo in case anything happens to him. On his trip back home he stops to see Vesuvius, and is caught by a sudden eruption and smothered under the hot ashes. He is, however, rescued, and under the treatment of a great scientist, is restored to health; his physical disabilities have also been removed, and he is straight and rejuvenated in appearance, so much so that the doctor tells him he would not be believed if he declared himself to be David Angelo, and he decides to let the world believe that he is dead. He returns to Rome and startles the national treasurer by his brilliant suggestions in connection with finance, spies on the conspirators who are seeking to compromise his wife, is introduced in his own home without being recognized, and prevents his wife's fortune being stolen by his former partner.

When a delegation of the Herero and Nama tribes travels to Berlin during a 'Colonial Exhibition', he takes a special interest in their young female translator Kezia Kambazembi as subject for his studies. Impressed by her intellect, he begins to question the common racial theories of white supremacy, whilst the delegation fails in their attempt to negotiate for better conditions with the German Kaiser and returns to Namibia, where the political tensions are growing worse over time and culminate in the Herrero uprising and brutal retaliations of the German imperial army. In this tense atmosphere, Hoffmann eagerly joins an ethnological expedition under the army's protection to gather scientifically 'valuable' artifacts, whilst trying to collect further proof for his progressive theories and to find Kezia. Hoffmann experiences the brutality of war and the massacres among the local population. Slowly he begins to lose his moral compass with his ambitions depending on the promotion by the opportunistic and deeply racist professor von Waldstätten. When he finally encounters the brutalized Kezia in a concentration camp, he can neither face her nor himself. Hoffmann achieves his career goals by denying his true beliefs and chooses not to speak out against the common theory of white supremacy that will soon contribute to an even darker chapter in German history.",

Gloria is sixteen and vivacious, bubbling over with fun and good spirits, and naturally resents the rules and regulations under which her governess would have her follow. However, she takes advantage of every chance to escape the governess' eye, and romps about like a tom-boy. Family friends Judge Freeman and his daughter, Lois, also arrive in Palm Beach, where Lois is being courted by Dr. Stephen Royce, who also pays a lot of attention to Gloria. Brother David thinks Lois is swell. Richard Freneau, a young broker, becomes acquainted with both families, and is soon a rival of David's for the swell Lois. Glora takes a night drive along the beach in David's new racing automobile and manages to drive it into the ocean, where it doesn't float. She escapes but loses her way when she attempts to walk home alone, and the dawn finds her wandering around in the Everglades. She has borrowed a suit of boy's clothes, as her wet gown was not suitable for Everglade exploring, and is found by some Seminole Indians. Freneau, looking for her finds that Dr. Steve has found her first. However, while Dr. Steve is engaged in some hand-to-hand combat with one of the hostile Indians, Freneau, the Cad, escorts her safely home, and is unjustly hailed as her rescuer, since Gloria was unconscious when Dr. Steve came upon the scene. Back home in New York City, Freneau has made his case and is soon engaged to Gloria, while Dr. Steve remains a silent witness on the sidelines. Gloria has to determine which man is the best man for her, and she eventually does so - after nineteen more damsel-in-distress chapters.",

    "description": "In the heartlands of Jharkhand, where the echo of crime reverberates through the dense forests, emerges the gripping tale of \"RANCHI.\" Directed by Shashikanth Gatti and portrayed by Prabhu Mundkur as Deepak, the film delves into a true incident that shook the criminal underbelly of the region. The story revolves around a joint operation orchestrated by SSP Pravin Kumar, played by an intense and determined character, bringing to life the meticulous planning and execution that went into dismantling the most notorious dacoit gang in 2009. This gang, notorious for terrorizing the regions of Jharkhand and Bihar, had eluded law enforcement for far too long. The narrative takes an intriguing turn when Shashikanth Gatti, portrayed by Prabhu Mundkur as Deepak, unintentionally becomes an unwitting hero in the fight against crime. Gatti, known for his directorial prowess, stumbles upon a script that inadvertently mirrors the activities of the infamous dacoit gang. Recognizing the potential to turn fiction into reality, Gatti approaches SSP Pravin Kumar with his findings. What follows is a high-stakes collaboration between the creative mind of Shashikanth Gatti and the strategic acumen of SSP Pravin Kumar. Together, they devise a plan straight out of a film script, involving undercover operations, stakeouts, and heart-pounding confrontations. As the line between fiction and reality blurs, the audience is taken on a rollercoaster ride of suspense, action, and unexpected twists. Prabhu Mundkur's portrayal of Deepak captures the essence of Shashikanth Gatti's real-life journey, showcasing the internal conflicts, moral dilemmas, and the sheer courage it took to bring down the formidable dacoit gang. The film unfolds as a thrilling narrative that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats, a rarity in Kannada cinema. \"RANCHI\" is not just a crime thriller; it's a testament to the power of collaboration between art and reality. The film pays homage to the unsung heroes behind the scenes who, inspired by a director's vision, step into the roles of justice seekers. As the credits roll, the audience is left with a chilling reminder that sometimes, truth is indeed stranger-and more thrilling-than fiction.",

Coaxed into a gambling house, he loses his last dollar, and then is given a job as dealer. One evening there is a fight during which a man is killed. Checkers is suspected, but innocent. Fearful, he determines to get away from the city. Meeting a race horse tout, Push Miller, they make their way south to the track. Winning some money, they follow the horses to Hot Springs, Ark. Arthur Kendall, a young man from Clarksville. Ark., gets very friendly with Checkers. Kendall goes off on a spree, and his sweetheart, Pert Barlow, and her father come to bring him home. Arthur will go only if Checkers accompanies him. Wishing to earn an honest living, Checkers takes the opportunity, and goes to work in the general store of Arthur's father. Pert Barlow breaks her engagement with Arthur, and Checkers falls in love with her. Pert Barlow's father, wishing her to marry Arthur Kendall, forbids Checkers to see her, and tells him not to come back to Clarksville until he has made $5,000 by honest work. Pert gives Checkers an old California gold piece as a love token. Leaving Clarksville, Checkers is unable to secure any employment. He tries again and again. One day, broke, he drifts down to the track, hoping to meet some of his old friends from whom he can borrow money. Pert Barlow, her father, Arthur Kendall, and others from Clarksville are at the track that same day. In desperation at seeing Pert and Arthur together, Checkers bets the $50 gold piece Pert had given him on a horse called Remorse, at odds of 100 to 1. Remorse wins. Seeing Checkers, the father of Pearl tears her away. Checkers follows them to Clarksville. As his $5,000 has not been earned by honest work, Checkers knows he cannot claim Pert. But while he is in Clarksville a run is started on the bank owned by Pert's father. Checkers uses his ready wit in holding the crowd of clamoring depositors, and finally saves the day by the deposit of the $5,000 which he has won. At this, Pert's father declares that he needs Checkers as a son-in-law; Pert approves the choice, and all are happy.",

Blaine is transferred to a little wayside station, far removed from all other habitation, and before going persuades Nellie to marry him. At first, love for her husband absorbs Nellie's whole thought, but gradually the intense loneliness at the deserted post begins to pall on her and she longs for companionship and her old home. She meets Stephen Carter, Jr., a wealthy idler, traveling about with his father. During his enforced stop at the little station, Carter amuses himself by flirting with Nellie and finds her an eager listener to his stories of life in the big city. However, when he tries to persuade her to go with him she refuses. After his departure, Nellie is more lonely and dissatisfied than ever. Tom, who is perfectly contented, cannot understand her attitude, and resents her longing for other companionship. He upbraids her for complaining and hot words are spoken. Tom arrogantly tells her if she does not like the life, she may return home and remain there. Heartbroken, Nellie goes back to her uncle's house, Stephen again meets her and tries to induce her to go to the city with him. While he is pleading with her, John, who has somewhat repented his hasty action, enters, his suspicions, previously aroused by a note Stephen had written to Nellie, are confirmed when he sees the two together. Denouncing Nellie, he tells her he is through with her and she may go with Stephen. Cast out by her aunt, Nellie leaves for the city to strive to forget her unhappiness. She struggles, but without success. One day she is knocked over by an auto driven by Flynn, who she had known at the Wayside station. Through Flynn, Stephen is informed of her whereabouts and, unknown to her, he secures a position for her and gradually gets her into his debt. Unhappy among her uncongenial associates, Nellie realizes that life surrounded by gayety and people can be equally as lonely as life at a deserted wayside station. Longing for John, she writes, begging forgiveness, and hinting at a great secret. Stephen, feeling that he has waited long enough, reveals the truth of her position to Nellie and demands payment for his favors. While she struggles against his advances, the door is opened and John rushes in. Stephen is thrown out, and husband and wife realize that love is the only thing in the world.",

Her utter honesty and fearlessness command the respect of all the \"boys.\" Of her many suitors, the one she is most disposed to favor is Jack Rance, the sheriff-gambler from New Orleans, who is somewhat less rough than the rest of the men. At the time when the story begins the community is at a high pitch of excitement concerning the exploits of a city-bred road-agent, whose real name is Johnson, but who is known as Ramerrez and leads a particularly desperate band of Mexicans. In spite of the fact that $5,000 has been offered for his capture, Ramerrez holds up the Wells-Fargo stage, robbing all the passengers. While doing this, he receives a slight wound on the wrist and when his band disperses with the booty remains behind to bathe the injury. The \"Girl\" chances to ride by, is interested by her very first glimpse of the fascinating stranger, comes to his aid and binds up the wound with part of her bonnet string. This is the beginning of the romance between the \"Girl\" and the road-agent, whom she knows only as \"Mr. Johnson.\" Not knowing that the \"Girl\" is the proprietor of the Polka Saloon in Cloudy, but having heard that the miners leave their gold in the care of the woman who runs that place, Ramerrez plans to rob the establishment. He goes to the saloon himself in advance, and there meets Rance, the sheriff-gambler, whose jealousy at once becomes apparent and who is prevented from making trouble for the stranger then and there only because the \"Girl\" vouches for him. From this point, exciting events follow in rapid succession. While Rance is following a blind trail for the road-agent, Ramerrez has an early morning breakfast with the \"Girl\" at her cabin. In attempting to leave, he is seriously wounded by Rance, and apprehended though the \"Girl\" seeks to conceal him in the loft. His presence is revealed by the dropping of his blood through the cracks of the loft. Rance and the \"Girl\" play cards for the life of Ramerrez, and the \"Girl\" wins by the ruse of changing her losing cards at the last moment. After recovering from his wounds, Ramerrez is pursued and caught a second time. The \"Girl\" comes to his rescue at the moment when he is about to be hung for his crimes against the law, and the drama concludes with the \"Girl\" and Ramerrez leaving the Mountain to begin a new life.",

    "description": "Marie, the daughter of Emile De Severac, a novelist, is home from the convent. She is betrothed to George Renoir, an artist friend of her father, who is devotedly in love with her. Marie has suddenly developed flirtatious symptoms and to warn and guard her against the trouble she is likely to create for herself and others, unless she ceases her folly, De Severac tells her the plot of his unpublished story, \"Black Orchids.\" Zoraida is a sorceress whose only aim in life seems to be the entanglement of men in her meshes. Sebastian De Maupin is envious of his son Ivan, who is temporarily in Zoraida's favor, and to get rid of the youthful lover the father uses his influence to have his boy sent to the front line of battle in the war then raging. Sebastian De Maupin, thinking himself now in sole possession of Zoraida's affections, introduces her to Marquis De Chantal, a rich and handsome nobleman, upon whom Zoraida turns her attentions. Enraged because Zoraida seems to have abandoned him, De Maupin arranged a dinner at which he plans to poison De Chantal and be thus rid of his rival. Zoraida changes the cups and De Maupin drinks the poisoned brew, dying instantly. Ivan now comes home from war, wounded in body, but still fired in his heart with love for Zoraida. The wretch quickly turns her affections again toward Ivan, creating jealousy in De Chantal's heart, and a duel results. Ivan inflicts what is believed to be a fatal wound upon De Maupin and goes with Zoraida to an estate De Chantal has bequeathed to her in a will he made when the count was basking in the woman's favor. De Chantal is indeed fatally wounded, but lives long enough to avenge himself upon the fickle Zoraida and her youthful lover. In the castle De Chantal he has willed to Zoraida is an air-tight vault and there the count causes the woman and her lover to be entrapped, where they must die of suffocation, while De Chantal at last expires of his wound, upon the doorsill of the living tomb of Zoraida and Ivan. When Emile De Severac has finished the narrative, his daughter, Marie, is penitent and remorseful, because she has given her sweetheart pain, and the once fickle and flirtatious girl lives now with her eyes open to the danger of her folly.",

But, save for the love of drinking and of fighting, Moll keeps to \"the straight road\" and the other temptations of her squalid life leave her unscathed. One day Moll is attacked by Liz, a disreputable woman in Bill Hubbell's saloon; the two women fight and are arrested. On their way past the settlement, Ruth Thompson a wealthy young settlement worker and her fiancé, Douglas Ames, see the pitiful procession, but Ruth insists that Moll and the others be brought into the settlement until she has the affair investigated. They come in and with them Bill Hubbell, the handsome and athletic saloon-keeper, and when he tells the true story of Moll's being first attacked by Liz. Moll is released, at the solicitation of Ruth Thompson. When the others have gone, Ruth pleads with Moll to quit drinking, and aided by the pleading of Mike Finnerty, a little crippled boy, Moll at last gives in, the callous indifference of her nature vanishes, and she becomes a different creature. Mrs. Finnerty, made kindly by Moll's love for little Mike, takes her home with her and a new life begins for Moll. Bill Hubbell, the saloon-keeper, instead of being offended by Moll's abstaining from his wares, encourages her, and a friendship springs up between the two that soon ripens into romance. But Douglas Ames, though engaged to Ruth, with the day set for their wedding, has determined to make a conquest of Moll, and one day, just as she is leaving Ruth, having told of her engagement to Bill, Ames follows and catches her in his arms. Ruth comes upon them, and Ames treacherously throws the fault on Moll, pretending that she had made advances to him, which he was repelling. Naturally, Ruth believes the man she loves in preference to the girl from the gutter, but at last promises the frantic Moll that she will come to her rooms at Finnerty's at 6 o'clock the following evening. After Moll leaves, Ames follows, as Moll knew he would, and begs that he be allowed to visit her. She coquettes with him and promises to be at home to him at six next evening, determined that Ruth shall find him and realize his vileness and the truth of Moll's story. But Bill Hubbell sees and overhears the appointment, and the next night when Ames calls, Bill, instead of Ruth, bursts into the room and sees Ames in the act of embracing Moll. In vain Moll tries to tell Bill the trap she had set for Ames. He laughs scornfully, and when Ruth enters tells her what he saw. Ames sneaks away, and both Ruth and Bill leave, believing Moll guilty. The frenzied and desperate Moll seizes the whiskey Ames had brought her and starts to drink, determined to go back to the gutter, when her despairing eyes fall on the sweet pictured face of the Madonna, a gift from Ruth. Throwing away the liquor, Moll falls on her knees and prays for succor and vindication. How her prayer is answered, her enemy crushed, her innocence established and her love and faith restored is developed in the climax of this drama.",

They have a charming daughter, Stella by name, and their life in Naples on Romani's great estates is one of love and happiness. Both husband and wife are fond of Guido Ferrari, who is a constant visitor at their home, and whose friendship for Fabio has been lifelong. A great cholera plague ravages the populace of Naples and Fabio one day decides to go to town in spite of the danger, on an errand of importance. On his return he is seized with the cholera, and drops to the street. He is picked up by the hooded doctors, pronounced dead, and, as a precaution against infection, his body is immediately placed on a cheap wooden casket and buried in the long disused Romani family vault. After some hours of apparent death his body stirs. He breathes, feels, moves and his casket slips from the niche and falls to the floor of the vault, taking with it a coffin that had lain undisturbed for many centuries on a lower tier. Romani struggles to his feet and the truth dawns on him. He immediately plunges into the casket now broken open and finds tremendous riches in gold, silver and diamonds with a note stating that they had been placed there by a pirate many generations ago. Almost overcome by his adventure, and suffering an agony of mental torture, Fabio's hair turns white in a single hour. He finally breaks free of the tomb and rushes through the garden to his mansion. From behind an ornamental column he sees his old friend Guido embracing his wife and determines upon a horrible revenge. He hurries to the nearest town, buys a pair of green spectacles and a suit of clothes. Armed with almost inexhaustible riches of the treasure chest, he assumes the name of Count Oliva and after a lapse of time, returns to the scene of his misfortunes. He succeeds in obtaining an introduction to Guido and in course of time the two become fast friends. He professes himself to be an old friend of the dead Count Romani's father. In course of time he meets his faithless wife and soon becomes an almost daily visitor at his own home. At this time his child Stella is taken sick and dies. Before the little girl passes away, Fabio makes himself known to her. The wealth of Fabio dazzles Nina and, being faithless, selfish and mercenary, he has but little difficulty in laying the foundation of his vengeance. Guido leaves town for a period and during the interval, Fabio receives the consent of Nina to become his wife and to jilt Guido. Fabio then announces a grand dinner in honor of Guido's return and, at the psychological moment, announces to the assembled guests the engagement of himself and Nina. Guido, stung to the quick, strikes Fabio and a duel follows, in which Guido is mortally wounded. Before he expires, Fabio removes his green glasses and reveals his identity to the dying Guido. The night of the wedding arrives with its hundreds of guests. On that night just before the supper, Fabio takes Nina by the hand and leads her to the vault, telling her that he will show her the source of his fabulous wealth and the ever mercenary Nina follows to the door of the vault where she hesitates. Fabio seizes her and throws her through the open door and then follows himself. Safely in the vault, he discloses his identity and the shock drives Nina insane. The sight of the once beautiful woman now a crazed being with distorted face, playing among the jewels in the treasure chest, almost causes Fabio's cold heart to relent. Suddenly the earth moves beneath them. There is a rush and roar of crashing pillars, a mighty stone hurtles through the roof of the tomb, striking Nina and killing her instantly. Fabio, believing it the vengeance of the Gods, rushes from the mined vault in panic. Thus is the Vendetta accomplished.",

When the officers leave the room a Hindoo sent by Indore's husband poisons the decanter of wine. Unger returns and is astonished to see Indore, who has made her way to him. He consents to take her away, drinks the wine, and falls dead. Indore lifts the glass to her lips to die with him, but it is snatched from her by the native, who carries her back to his prince. She is reduced to slavery in the harem. Duane takes the child, Agatha, to England. Agatha develops into a beautiful woman. She is reading a message from Duane with a heavy heart, for it says he is on his way with his bride, Florence, to join his father on his journey to India. En route they meet the Grand Duke Alexis, who has known Florence in the past. Alexis, perceiving that Florence is jealous of Agatha, forces her to think her husband loves the Indian girl. In India, Alexis informs Agatha her mother is not dead and that she might see her. Guided by a native, Agatha confronts the prince and asks for her mother; he parries her question. Looking at her with a lustful smile, he draws near and she retreats in terror. Struggling fiercely, the girl screams as he overpowers her. Indore hears the scream, slips into the room and stabs the prince. She recognizes her child and clasps her in her arms. Thus the guard finds them. Jang Sahib, the hunchback, rushes in when he hears the guard's shriek, and orders the native to spread the news that their prince has been murdered by an English infidel. Soon there is a riot and many white men are slain. Captain Duane, discovering that Agatha has gone to the palace, hastens with a few horsemen. Jang Sahib tells Duane Agatha is not there. Duane fights. Meanwhile Florence, convinced by Alexis of her husband's infidelity, has left on a steamer with him, leaving a note for Duane. While crossing the desert in Sahib's caravan, Indore jumps over the cliff. She is later picked up by some traders still alive, but has lost her memory. At the Walled City Sahib compels Agatha to marry him. On the wedding day she grasps him by the throat and chokes him to death. Duane, crushed by despair, shuns the haunts of white men. He wanders into a native dive, and is startled by the sight of a dancing girl. He staggers to her and, in spite of the curses of the people, leads her out. It is Indore, whom he mistakes for Agatha. She does not even remember her child's name, but when left alone in Duane's home is stabbed by the prince's servant. She is shocked into her right mind and demands to know where Agatha is imprisoned. At the head of a troop, Duane goes to the Walled City in time to snatch Agatha from the funeral pyre into which she is being forced by the subjects of the murdered Sahib. They escape and begin their journey back. Duane and Agatha are happy at seeing each other again.",

At last Watts falls in the company of the Parisian Belles Variety Company, where he gives impersonations. His fellow-players have no particular sympathy with him, save one young girl, an acrobat, and a great friendship springs up between them. The manager of the company, Stoner, has taken a fancy to the girl and has decided to take the night's receipts at a certain town and flee, taking the girl with him. She refuses to go. During the performance that night she is so nervous that she falls from her trapeze and is injured. So Stoner flees alone, leaving the company stranded. Old Watts and the girl face the world together. At a nearby town they are giving a Shakespearian revival, and Watts takes her there in hope of getting work. He introduces her as his daughter. He finds plenty to do, and soon is living prosperously, while the little girl gets her first taste of a life of refinement. The young man who runs the local hotel falls in love with her and she with him. But just as things are running smoothly, Stoner turns up. He tries to blackmail Watts, telling him that unless he gives him money he will reveal the fact that Watts is not the girl's father, and also show up the girl to the staid townsfolk as a former acrobat who wore tights. The wedding guests are waiting. As Ulysses turns to enter the church, Stoner shoots him. Ulysses goes in and reassures the guests, and then comes a thrilling finish.",

    "description": "Frank Andrews is a successful businessman. He has always found pride and joy in the company of his wife, son and daughter. He suddenly finds himself enthralled by the advances of a gay young woman siren, who lives in the same apartment house as he does. So marked an influence does she have over him as time progresses that at last he quite forgets his home ties, neglects his family, and goes the way of many other men who have forgotten the meaning of paternity and blood ties. The story is advanced through many scenes enacted with the accompanying notes of New York's night life, and the denouement comes when the faithful wife discovers her husband's infidelity. At this time the mother's mind nearly loses balance, while Jane, the beautiful daughter, crazed by the grief of her mother, determines to take part in the tragedy. With revolver in hand she steals up to the apartment of the woman, but her frail nature is overcome by the temperamental anger of the woman and her mission fails. However, the errand is not fraught with failure for the father, coming in at this moment, finds his daughter being made love to by the sweetheart of the young woman, and realizes the road upon which he has traveled. When he confronts his daughter and says, \"You, my daughter, what are you doing here?\" The daughter answers, \"My father, what are you doing here?\" The realization is brought home to the father's mind that the law of moral ethics that governs a woman's life necessarily governs that of wan as well. Reformation comes in his character. He takes his daughter away with him and together they go back to their home of happiness and content.",

Separated from his family, he meets Yu Mei, a young Chinese woman, and they fall in love. Lu Shin survives thanks to his martial art skills and his intelligence, earning his freedom, but he can't rescue Yu Mei. When invading Peruvian territory, commander Patricio Lynch liberates hundreds of Chinese slaves from the guano mines and the plantations. The freed Chinese, in the middle of a war that isn't theirs, don't know where to go, so they follow Lynch. When they reach the town where Lu Shin lives, he finds his brother among the liberated slaves, and meets his wife, who turns out to be Yu Mei. Lynch hires Lu Shin as a guide, and he will become his translator, friend and confidante. To distract himself from his forbidden love, Lu Shin organizes and commands a Chinese battalion that will change history. Lu Shin, the \"Warrior of the Celestial Empire\" and Lynch, dubbed \"the Red Prince\" by the Chinese, share a journey into the heart of war, forced to make decisions that involve sacrifice, loss and death. Lu Shin and his battalion are key to the conquest of Lima, where he manages to save his sister from the great massacre of Chinese, but not his father, who reveals a tragic secret with his last breath: it was Lynch that killed his grandparents in Canton, during the Opium Wars, when he was a cadet in the British Navy.

    "description": "Venice, what emotions it awakens in the Young Stranger as he reads about it in his book. He decides to pay this beautiful city a visit. Upon his arrival, he walks from the railroad station to the landing place on the Grand Canal. There the crowd watches him with amusement as he blunderingly makes his way. Pitrello, a hotel tout, sees in the awkward Young Stranger a likely mark. He seizes his baggage, hurries him into a gondola and conducts him through a network of canals and bridges to the hotel. In the meantime, the Bridegroom, a rich wine merchant, is escorting his young Bride to the church where they are to be married. She is unutterably sad because her heart is elsewhere. Suddenly her face lights up; nearby stands the Officer, her true love. And now the gondola of the Young Stranger nears the scene. He lands and, as he is looking about curiously, the bridal party passes and he is smitten with the beauty of the pale Bride. After the services the bridal party proceeds toward the hotel, the same one for which the Young Stranger is headed. The Young Bride cannot forget her Officer. She throws a rose to him as he stands below looking at her pleadingly. The Young Stranger, mistaking her intention, thinks the rose is meant for him. A merry wedding feast is held in the courtyard of the hotel. The Officer waits for stolen sweets and the Bride smiles at him. Her smiles the Young Stranger intercepts and takes for himself. Love's message meant for another. While the dancing continues, the Bride pleads sudden indisposition and retires to her room. The Young Stranger in an adjoining room goes to sleep with the rose of his romance at his lips. The events of the day had made a deep impression upon him, and now his brain, active in sleep, conjures up before him a wonderful dream. At first all the people he met during the events of the day pass before him in a shadowy dance. Then he sees the room of the Bride. Within it stands the Officer, pleading with her. There is a knock at the door. What shall she do? She hides him behind the curtains and the Bridegroom enters. He has been drinking very freely. But now Pitrello drops from the upper transom. Unseen by the Bridegroom, he stealthily creeps behind the curtain and engages in mortal combat with the Officer. He kills the Officer, but so swiftly and silently is this accomplished that only the Bride, her face turned toward the combatants, is aware of the tragedy. She renews her pleading with her husband that he leave her room for the night. He yields to her request. The criminal Pitrello had, in the meantime, escaped. Terror-stricken, the Bride hides the dead body in her own bed. From the Young Stranger's room the Bride hears a song of love. An idea occurs to her. She will ask him to dispose of the body for her. He sees her, dresses rapidly and follows. The Young Stranger pleads his love. Suddenly the Bride horrifies him by showing him the corpse. She entreats him to help her. At first he is reluctant, but finally he consents. The Young Stranger drags the body to the balcony. Pitrello, however, dogs his every step and frustrates his intentions. Here is an opportunity, the deep well. Into its depth the dead body will go. But no, Pitrello squats upon the lid and the Young Stranger drags the corpse to a boat. He boards the boat with his dreadful charge, so does Pitrello. For the far-off shores of the Island of the Dead he steers and there he throws the body into the silent waters of the lagoon. At last he is free to rejoin the Bride. But Pitrello leaps into the waters and drags the body back to shore. Then he conjures up three more bodies. He sets them up, one after another, like so many nine-pins and the Young Stranger recoils from the ghastly sight. Outlined in shadow, the little craft re-crosses the waters of the lagoon. When the Young Stranger lands, however, he is again confronted with peril. The Officer, come to life, rushes at him, sword in hand. They fence and the Young Stranger is victorious. Another Officer, however, leaps toward him. Another scuffle. Thus he struggles with the four and kills them. But he has reckoned without Pitrello. His Evil Genius breathes hack the spark of life into them. They arise and pursue the fleeing Young Stranger. A vast mob brandishing weapons follows after. But the Young Stranger manages to reach the Bride's room. There he relates his fearful misadventures. She listens to him sadly and at last rewards him with a kiss. The drinking and dancing had continued in the lobby of the hotel all through the night. The Bridegroom, drunk, is conducted by the servants, under the leadership of Pitrello, into the Young Stranger's room. They deposit the Bridegroom in the Young Stranger's bed. But the Young Stranger soon begins to feel the weight of his little bed partner. At first he imagines that the hand he holds belongs to the Bride, but he is soon disillusioned. In disgust, he wriggles his way out of bed, dresses and gets ready for departure. The Bride has come out smiling and inquires after her husband. There is much commotion among the servants working eagerly for the much coveted tips. Pitrello, ever quick, has stirred into action even the lazy fellow, who, tired from the revelry of last night, is sleeping on the stairs. All is bustle and hurry-scurry as the bridal party leaves in a gondola. Poor Young Stranger. His dream of love cannot stand the daylight of reality. Sadly he notes how the Bride has made room in the gondola for the Officer. The fat Bridegroom is too stupid to know her real feelings, but the Young Stranger understands. He presses to his lips the cherished rose of sweet romance, and as the bridal party glides under the bridge on which he is standing, he showers its petals upon her.",

    "description": "Vivid fighting scenes photographed under fire by Mutual cameramen under special contract with General Villa are the features of this motion picture. Many scenes are shown of the Battle of Torreon. They show the Constitutionalist forces advancing under fire with the shrapnel kicking up the dirt all around. Many other interesting scenes are shown of the artillery in action under fire, laying railroad track under fire and similar war time activities. General Villa himself, with his generals, appears in many of the scenes. The famous Constitutionalist leader is seen to good advantage. The old saying that \"War is Hell\" is well exemplified in the pictures showing the burning of the dead and other views of the seamy side of the conflict. Some of the battle scenes are shown as battle scenes. Other views of the actual fighting are worked into a film dramatization of the life of General Villa, which is preceded on the screen by a sub-title, \"The Tragedy in the Career of General Villa.\" This tells the story of Villa's life as follows: Years ago, Pancho Villa was a young rancher living alone with his young sister and doing well. One day a young lieutenant of the Mexican Federal Army came to that locality with another young officer. The lieutenant became smitten with Villa's sister, and with the aid of his companion, abducted her and ruined her. The sister, after telling her brother, died, and Villa journeyed to the garrison town and killed the lieutenant, but the companion escaped. Villa then sold his rancho and with a small body of his men escaped to the mountains, vowing warfare on all mankind in revenge for the death and ruin of his sister. He became a bandit, and by meeting and defeating other bandits, became the chief of a great band and the terror of the northern part of Mexico. He was particularly sore at the Federal Government, and when the revolution broke out, he sided with the revolutionists and their leader. Sallying forth from the mountains he blew up trainloads of Federals and met and defeated every Federal army that was sent against him, captured town after town and city after city. At the last great and decisive battle he met face to face the Federal officer who had assisted in the abduction of his sister and helped to start him on his road to banditry and outlawry and killed him with his own hands upon the battlefield. The Federals were defeated, and Villa is finally proclaimed president of the great Republic of Mexico, he who once was an outlaw with a price upon his head.",

    "description": "Leandre Sanders was born in Venice Beach, LA, into a world of gangs and crime. The only thing that kept him out of trouble was his love of skateboarding. While his older brothers joined the family tradition of running with gangs, Leandre - dubbed Skategoat - spent most of his days and nights at Venice Beach skatepark with his younger brother Leontay. He was so talented and determined that, at the age of 11, he caught the eye of filmmaker Van Alpert. Over the next ten years, Van documented Leandre's struggle to perfect his skateboarding and to survive. At 14-years old, Leandre was forced to leave his rapidly unravelling family life and started sleeping rough at the bowl of the skate park, relying on his friend Haden and the kindness of a local woman, Katie, who looked out for the two boys. And despite this adversity, Leandre never lost his drive to skate - Set against the visually palpable decline of LA, the decade captured by Van charts Leandre's journey to an internationally-respected skater who has perfected his own unique 'no stance' skate style. The result is a gritty reflection of what it takes to make it in the skating world - and what it takes to survive as a disadvantaged kid in the United States. Pulsing with a tactile sense of street style and punctuated by an incredible soundtrack. Skategoat is a story about the streets told from the streets, that proves anyone can seize their dream.",

    "description": "\"The Woman\" is brought up on a farm by a miserly uncle who denies her the company of other young people. It is no wonder then that she is introduced by a traveling mining stock broker. When the uncle learns her plight, he puts her out. A storm is raging. The girl seeks shelter in the same place as the man who has seduced her. He persuades her to go to a nearby town and marry him. She does, but shortly after the ceremony she discovers that he is already married, when his wife and the police come and take him. Deserted and alone, the girl finds out that her uncle has been killed in the storm, and has left her his money. She takes it and goes to a small city where she lives. Five years later her little son is quite a lad, and they are living happily. The woman is known as a widow. Two men fall in love with her, a prominent physician and a broker. The broker wins his suit. Later her husband engages a chauffeur for the woman. When the man arrives at the house she discovers that it is the man who betrayed her. He threatens to expose her unless she keeps him supplied with money. She dares not refuse. He treats their son cruelly. One day the broker sees the chauffeur hit the lad and discharges him on the spot. The chauffeur again threatens the woman, this time telling her that if he does not get his job back he will reveal the truth about her. The woman goes to her husband's office when he is not in, and meets the chauffeur there. He flourishes a gun and a struggle ensues. The man is shot and the woman runs away. The coroner finds a locket in the hand of the dead man that belongs to the woman. He keeps the incriminating bit of evidence for the trial. The woman hides herself, unknowing that her husband has been arrested for the murder. A vision of the penitentiary causes her to hasten to court where she tells of the man's attack upon her. This testimony clears the husband, and both are discharged. She determines to have her mind free of the shadow of her secret, and tells her husband the true story of her life when they return home. She is forgiven.",

By 1974, as 'The Troubles' were reaching a bloody and vicious peak, five boys in total had vanished from within a five-mile radius of each other. Fifty years later, these disappearances remain unsolved and families continue to search for answers.

Sunny is in bed with as queer a lot of associates as could be collected. He has recruited his following from the bread line; two of them are in bed with him while the others are sleeping on the carpet, and one has even gone to rest in the bathtub. Not too willingly do all hands go to the shower, but it is a wash or no breakfast. Downstairs goes the motley array and into the dining room. Sunny thinks it fine that such a spread has been prepared for his guests and there is little left when sister enters with her guests. Of course, Sis at once tells father and Sunny is called to book. Dismissing his own guests, he finds that he has only one friend in the place, one of his sister's guests, and he doesn't know her name. She thinks Sunny is splendid and when his father has sent him out to try his sociological theories along the Bowery, she wishes him luck. There in a cheap lodging house Sunny teaches the derelicts to laugh, and with such success that an eminent specialist drafts him to cure a millionaire grouch of dyspepsia. In the rich home of the dyspeptic he finds that the girl is the millionaire's daughter. She enters heartily into his plans but an aged 'cellist, whose favorite music is Chopin's \"Funeral March,\" exerts more influence in the household than he. But when father has discovered his daughter and the supposed physician in fond embrace there is a fight, which ends with father a prisoner in his room, to be cured by starvation. Meanwhile a broker, whose offer of marriage has been refused by the daughter, is plotting to ruin her father in Wall Street. How Sunny thwarts the attempt, cures the grouch, becomes his son-in-law and partner and thereby is reinstated in the good graces of his own family, is the story this comedy tells.",

The forest barely lives and this only due to a reserve that the Totobiegosode people achieved in a legal manner. They call Chaidi this place which means ancestral land or the place where we always lived and it is part of the \"Ayoreo Totobiegosode Natural and Cultural Heritage\". Before this, they had to live through the traumatic situation of leaving the territory behind and surviving a war. It is the story of the Ayoreo Totobiegosode people, told from the point of view of Asoja, a bird-god with the ability to bring an omniscient- temporal gaze, who becomes the narrator of this story developed in a crossing between documentary and fiction. It is a film that wants to tell the story of the Ayoreo people and the story of all the exiled. It aims to pre- serve a space of memory and wants to preserve a physical and a spiritual place - one that cannot be overthrown nor abolished.",

His indelible influence on contemporary art history formed a bridge between China's past and present, as well as the East and the West. Chang left China in 1949 and traveled throughout the world until he died in Taiwan in 1983. Over 34 years living overseas, he desired, created and lived in his dreamland, \"Peach Blossom Spring\" from Argentina to Brazil, then California and Taiwan. As the first Chinese artist holding the most well-known international exhibitions worldwide, and as the world's biggest selling artist at auctions, his paintings have been collected by top museums, galleries, and private collections throughout the world. Yet, Chang's art has been little known in the western world, and his life journey after 1949 has remained a mystery to most Chinese.",

Tommy can't shake the thought of a darkness following him since that night, and that there's someone moving in the shadow of his every step. Maybe that's why he's not performing so well in law school. That, or the fact his father, brilliant former defense attorney Dan Olson, is also his teacher. Exhausted from the pressures from his mom, two sisters at home, and his father's bullying at school, he graduates and makes an effort to carve his own path. Tommy feels the only way he can measure up, is if he pushes himself to join a law firm separate from his father's connections, in the prying eyes of his family. But a dark force surrounds the Midwest suburb, and people from his past who are reported dead by a mysterious killer, who is stalking them at random. The visions of deathly premonitions become stronger as Tommy starts his first day as part of the new law firm. Tommy meets Olivia and it was a welcome romantic interest that pulls him away from the chaos of his life. The sparks between them are quickly snuffed out by blood soaked memories unlocking in his mind. Tommy must decide whether to share these visions with her or to keep a secret. He can't help but feel he is being shoved into a sinister puzzle he does not want to put together because he just may be, the last piece.",

    "description": "When responding to any fire, the main objective for firefighters is to extinguish it as quickly as possible and protect the public from exposure. In the process, firefighters put themselves in harms way. Not just from the fire itself, but with what lurks within. After the fire is out they continue to sift through the rubble looking for hot spots or anything that could put the community in danger. Closer and closer they approach the toxic by-products of combustion. Hazardous gases created by things that were never meant to be burned, hidden behind the smoke. Symptoms don't surface for years while others have immediate respiratory problems.

Beatrice sees his predicament and descends from Paradise into Limbo, where she asks the poet Virgil to rescue and guide Dante. Virgil knows another way to go, but this leads straight through the entire Inferno, before it continues towards Paradise. Virgil leads Dante to the portals of Inferno. Charon ferries them over the river Acheron, and then they start their journey downwards through the different circles of Inferno. Dante meets all kind of sinners and sees the never-ending punishments they have to undergo. The various punishments are adjusted to the different transgressions. Among the sinners Dante recognizes many persons he has met in Florence, when they were still alive. They tell him their sad stories and why they have ended here. At last Dante and Virgil meets the arch traitor Lucifer, who holds the bodies of Brutus and Cassius in his mouth. The two poets climb down the shaggy sides of Lucifer, to reach the subterranean way which leads out of Inferno.",

    "description": "Raoul Mendoza, a famous swordsman, in order to save his daughter from the temptations of Paris, sends her to the tropical South of France, to live with an old lighthouse keeper and his wife and son. Sometime later Mendoza is stricken with illness and is advised by his doctor to take a complete rest and an immediate change of air. Mendoza decides to join his daughter in the south. Through cunning, Marquise de Bregant secures an invitation from Mendoza to join in the trip and he accepts. Meanwhile, Caprice, the daughter of Mendoza is, quite unknown to her, loved by Jean, the son of Charcot, the old lighthouse keeper. She is also worshiped by Hannibal, an assistant at the lighthouse to Charcot, a mysterious man who was picked up on the sands, shipwrecked and never regained his memory. Mendoza and Bregant arrive at the village and Caprice is at once attracted by Bregant. Jean is jealous, and Hannibal, when he meets Bregant, almost awakened out of his dormant lethargy, behaves in a peculiar fashion. Juliette, having followed Bregant, arrives and meets him secretly. Caprice takes Bregant over the lighthouse. There is a little lovemaking which Hannibal sees and attacks Bregant in spite of the pleadings of Caprice. During the struggle Bregant recognizes Hannibal. Bregant makes arrangements with Caprice to elope. Hannibal finds out all, tells Mendoza, but he disbelieves him. Hannibal leaves and while gazing out of the window, Bregant passes. An old negro in his way begs alms. He knocks him down; the negro rises and he fells him again and beats and kicks him mercilessly as he lies on the ground. The fight partly restores Hannibal's memory, and he returns to Mendoza and reveals the hidden past. Two men went to South America on an exploring expedition, one was the Marquis de Bregant, the other Count Chambord. They were very successful, but particularly Chambord, who located gold mines. Bregant was, in consequence, exceedingly jealous. One day Bregant beat an old porter into insensibility. Chambord interfered, but was soon felled by Bregant, who took the latter's papers and returned to France, where he was acclaimed with high honors, giving out that poor Chambord died of fever. In the meantime, Chambord was nursed back to life by the natives, but his memory never returned and he eventually found himself upon a ship as a sailor until wrecked upon the shores of the South of France, where he remained as assistant lighthouse keeper to Charcot. As he finishes the story, Jean rushes in with the news that Bregant had gone off in his yacht and taken Caprice with him. The shock of such news is too much for Mendoza, and he is stricken with paralysis. Meanwhile, Caprice, who only consented to leave with Bregant under the promise of marriage on the boat, Bregant having told her that he had the minister, discovers that it is all a fraud. He fails in his attempt to drug her, and when he leaves to procure assistance, she locks herself in a cabin. When they reach port, Caprice escapes with the captain's assistance. Meantime, Jean, who has come to Paris in search of Caprice, by chance, one day, meets her. He persuades her to return to her father, who forgives her for her actions. Jean locates Bregant one night in a restaurant with his paramour, and a duel is arranged for the next day. Mendoza's prayer for the return of his strength is answered, and he swears vengeance upon his enemy. In the morning Bregant arrives in the woods to fight Jean, but to his horror and amazement, he meets Mendoza. Realizing he is doomed, he tries to avoid a fight, but is forced to it, and after a very thrilling encounter he is killed. Mendoza, Caprice and Jean then leave Paris forever to settle in the beautiful spot where Caprice spent her childhood days.",

    "description": "Before reaching his twentieth birthday, Caesar meets and falls madly in love with pretty Cornelia, daughter of Lucius Cinna. They are soon married despite the advice of their friends, who well know the bitter animosity existing between Sulla, dictator of Rome, and Lucius Cinna. The immediate result of this hasty marriage is an annulment and the banishment from Rome of Caesar. He leaves, vowing that the eternal city shall again hear of him. This does not occur until twenty years later, when he returns at news of Sulla's death and plunges briskly into the campaign for the consulship. In this he is aided by Calpurnia, daughter of the wealthy Piso. Caesar and Calpurnia are married and Caesar is elected to the consulship in the face of strong opposition by Cato, the younger, who fears the growing popularity of the still youthful statesman. To further fortify himself against the attacks of Cato, Caesar forms a political alliance with Pompey. which later grows into the first triumvirate consisting of Caesar, Pompey and Crassus. Caesar then gives his daughter Julia, by his first wife Cornelia, in marriage to Pompey and turns his restless ambition to greater fields. News that he will set out with an expeditionary force into Western Europe brings a strong protest from the Gauls. One day a beautiful Druidess visits Caesar and attempts to end his life, thwarted only by the ever-watchful, loving eye of Calpurnia. Not in the least daunted, Caesar pushes his campaign into Gaul with characteristic vigor, sweeps to destruction the formidable tribes headed by Vercingetorix in a series of the most brilliant battles recorded in history. and returns triumphant to Rome. Meanwhile. Pompey grows jealous of the conqueror's ever increasing power and stirs up the senate against him. citing the Roman law that no man may become proconsul and retain military command. Marc Antony warns Caesar, at Ravenna, of what he may expect in Rome while Marcus Brutus, nephew of Cato, visits Caesar with the senate's dictum. And Caesar, placing the matter squarely before his soldiers and receiving their answer, \"Without Caesar there is no Rome,\" orders his troops across the Rubicon. The senate declares him a traitor, but the populace hails him with acclaim and ceremony. Then the struggle for the mastery of the world begins. Caesar robs the Temple of Saturn to secure money for his troops and pursues Pompey to Pharsalus. where a desperate battle takes place, resulting in the annihilation of Pompey's army and the flight of its leader into Egypt. Back to Home goes victorious Caesar to fight no more and to be made Dictator for life. In 44 B.C., Julius Caesar, now fifty-six years of age, settles down to the administration of justice with a temperance and wisdom mellowed by age and experience. But his old enemy, Cato, intent upon the Dictator's destruction, hatches a conspiracy in which he and Brutus are the ringleaders. When veiled rumors of this reach Caesar he refuses to affront the dignity of the senate with armed guards and one day permits the opening, long watched for by the conspirators. Brutus touches him upon the shoulder and the next second a knife flashes in the air. Caesar reels, the target of a dozen blows, \"And thou, too, Brutus. Then fall Caesar.\" Pandemonium reigns. The city is aflame with riot and murder. Marc Antony, concluding his oration in the market place, smiles, \"Mischief, thou are afoot; take thou what course thou wilt.\"",

    "description": "Mae is a girl of the slums. Her antecedents are unknown. She works as a dancing girl around a rough dive where her sweetheart Bob is a waiter. Graves, a cheap sport, takes a fancy to Mae and asks the bartender who she is. The bartender tells him that nobody knows where she came from. When Graves becomes fresh with Mae, Bob warns him off. On their day off, Bob and Mae go walking in the park. They see young couples with their babies and long for a decent married existence. Judge Lewis, in his courtroom, is sternly sentencing a criminal who is pleading for mercy. A second judge enters the room and is invited to the bench as a matter of courtesy. He whispers to Judge Lewis in favor of the criminal, but Lewis is firm and sends the prisoner away condemned to the limit. Court adjourns and the two judges depart. They go down the courthouse steps and walk away to the park, where they see Bob and Mae. The second judge recognizes Bob and stops him. The judge asks him questions and Bob replies that he is behaving himself. Bob is eager to get away. Alone with Mae, Bob explains that the judge is the one that paroled him after his last fight. Back at work in the dive. Graves becomes offensive to Mae. He follows her to her room and is followed by Bob. A fight occurs in which Mae shoots Graves. Bob disappears, fearing the result of his parole if he should not obey the judge. Mae is to be tried before Judge Lewis. She is assigned a young attorney to defend her. The attorney sees her in her cell and gets her story. He can find no trace of Bob, who, however, keeps himself posted in hiding. The young attorney has secured from Mae, however, a locket given to her by her dead mother when she was a little child. The locket has a photo of her mother with the address of a photographer in a country town. The attorney visits the town, finds the old photographer, and is directed to Old Man Aitken as one who can tell about the woman of the photo. Aitken shows great emotion when he sees the photo, and on being told of Mae's coming trial before Lewis, shows great eagerness to go with the attorney. The trial is commenced, and the attorney admits the killing, but pleads self-defense and the girl's irresponsibility. He places her on the stand, and she tells her story. The judge is cold and relentless. She is asked on cross examination, \"Where is this man Bob?\" She doesn't know. Bob, however, has crept into the back of the courtroom. He presents himself and is examined. He corroborates Mae, but the judge, recognizing him as the boy of the park, discredits his testimony by asking him, \"Are you not a paroled prisoner?\" Bob admits it, and the effect on the jury is obvious. Mae is found guilty, with a recommendation for mercy. On being brought up for sentence, the attorney calls Aitken to prove the girl's irresponsibility. The prosecuting attorney jumps to his feet and objects. The judge is about to rule out Aitken's testimony, when Mae's attorney interposes, \"It will not be necessary to mention the name of the father of this defendant, but I will ask the witness to identify this photograph as the girl's mother.\" The portrait of the locket is passed to the judge. He conceals his emotion with difficulty. Mae's attorney proceeds, \"I will prove by this witness that the defendant's birth and early life are responsible.\" Aitken then tells his story, fading back to Mary Alden and Lewis, their love, the locket, Lewis' desertion to follow his career, sending her a letter telling her of his decision, the baby's birth, and the disappearance of mother and child. After the story the judge faints, court is adjourned, and the judge is carried out. The next day another judge is on the bench: he who had paroled Bob. He suspends sentence on Mae and she and Bob go away free. Judge Lewis is convalescent at his home in the country. Aitken brings Mae and Bob to him and he expresses his interest in them and determination to devote his life to his daughter.",

The guests fly in terror and Armada is wounded. Aurora alone remains undaunted, and Pedro, finding her, recognizes not only his love of the tavern, but Aurora, and that she is the wife of Armada. Notwithstanding her pleadings not to kill her husband, he is about to strike when he sees that Don Armada is blind. This awakens his pity and he leaves the house. Don Armada has an operation performed on his eyes which proves successful, but the physicians warn him that any shock may result in blindness for life. Aurora, in the meantime, has been carrying on clandestine meetings with Pedro and Armada, hoping to find out who Aurora's lover is, tells her that the operation has been a failure. He intercepts a note from Pedro and, locking Aurora in her room, stabs Pedro. He then returns to Aurora and she discovers he has tricked her. He tells her what he has done, but the shock kills him.

Kennedy himself has disappeared, although Elaine has a note from him begging her not to grieve whatever happens, for he is safe. And then, one night, on a barren strip of land jutting out into the Atlantic, a fisherman, concealed behind a rock, sees the periscope of a submarine rise; sees a man's head and shoulders rise seemingly out of the sea, and sees a pair of athletic arms strike out bravely for the shore. That night, at a hotel in New York, a distinguished-looking foreigner, much resembling the man who seemed to rise up out of the sea, is shadowed by a fussy old gentleman resembling the fisherman of the coast scenes. The foreigner goes out and the fussy old gentleman goes to his room, where, after a short, sharp struggle with a valet, he searches through all drawers and papers. One paper he pockets with glee, and then departs. Elaine and Jameson are visited by the distinguished-looking foreigner who tells them he is a secret service agent from Washington, and begs to get information with regard to Kennedy and the lost torpedo. Elaine's dog, digging with its forepaws in a pot of palms, unearths the lost torpedo and carries it to the attic, where he drops it behind a trunk. The torpedo's propeller, however, has been left in the palm-pot. where Marcius Del Mar, the foreigner, finds it. Elaine is suspected by him of having concealed the torpedo. The fussy old gentleman, in Del Mar's tracks since he left his rooms, is an interested spectator. He is unaware that Del Mar has spies guarding the house, and is set upon by them. Rushing madly into the conservatory, he faces Del Mar. Both draw their guns, but the fussy old gentleman fires first. His gun is loaded with bullets containing an overpowering gas. Both Del Mar and Elaine fall suffocated to the floor. How the fussy old gentleman escapes is a fitting climax to this episode.",

The merchant offers a reward for the pirate's apprehension and Caglioni, one of Wong Lee's henchmen, betrays his master. Bruce discovers the fact in time to notify Wong Lee. In gratitude, the pirate gives the American a ring guaranteed to give the wearer the allegiance of Chinamen in any part of the world.

He is reputed to receive large incomes from his estates, but in reality Bruce has adopted the Wong Lee method of equaling the wealth of the world.

To provide himself with an occupation that will give him wider scope for his practicing his peculiar style of philanthropy, Bruce retains his position with Nathan Goldberg, a merchant with social aspirations for his daughter. Marjorie Woods, a schoolmate of Miss Goldberg, arrives from Europe with Sir Archibald Bamford, a bankrupt nobleman, following closely in her wake, his eyes upon the fortune Miss Woods is reputed to possess.

At an opportune time Bruce gets the Goldberg pearls into his hands, and clumsily drops them to the ground, when, in picking them up, the young Chinese man substitutes worthless imitations for the string of expensive pearls and slips the real ones into his wide sleeve. The Goldberg pearls were intended to be subsequently disposed of through the Chinese man's source of distribution, Bruce to use the proceeds to build a hospital for the infirm and afflicted poor. Bruce and Marjorie have been invited to spend the night at the Goldbergs. Bruce wanders into the Goldberg drawing room in time to witness the burglary of the wall-safe where Goldberg deposited the spurious pearls for safekeeping. Caglioni is concerned in the burglary and has also recognized Bruce as the man who, in China, warned Wong Lee of his danger. Marjorie, restless, wanders into the drawing room and is another witness to the burglary. The girl is mystified by Bruce's strange conduct. Bruce confesses to Marjorie that he is a social buccaneer. Miss Woods induces him to abandon his peculiar pastime and become a good, dutiful husband.",

    "description": "The whole Ardath family is collected together to discuss the proposed marriage between Margaret and Robert Ogden, a British citizen. The consensus of opinion is that the match is desirable in every way. The old Colonel says that in case of war the children of such a match would make fine soldiers. This frightens Margaret, as all her life she has had a dislike for war. Dr. Ardath is on his way to an important conference and gets started on his favorite subject, the heart. He tells those present of a wonderful new drug that has been found by a Russian student who used it to depress the action of his heart to get out of military service and who, taking an overdose, was killed. The story makes a strong impression on Margaret and she falls into a troubled sleep. A boy is born to Margaret. All through his childhood he shows signs of being a fighter, and when he grows up he wants to join the National Guard. Margaret is forced to give in and consents. Shortly afterward, Donald, the son, becomes engaged to Patricia Landon. His father is called to England on business and he is put in full charge of the firm. A few months afterward, a letter comes from the other side saying that his father had enlisted when the war broke out. Margaret takes the news seriously, and Dr. Ardath is sent for. The doctor leaves his case of medicines on the table and Margaret sees the cardiac depressant in it. The idea at once comes to her that it might be of use to her in case the government should draft her son, so she takes the vial. Then comes the news that the United States and Mexico are going to war. She at once makes use of the medicine and so affects the action of Donald's heart that he is rejected. The boy is heartbroken and goes to tell Patricia. He receives a cold reception and later the girl's mother argues with her until she agrees to break the engagement owing to Donald's poor health. Donald takes to drink. His mother is heartbroken, as she thinks that she is to blame for it all, and hesitates to tell the boy that Patricia has married another man. Then the news comes that Robert is wounded. Dr. Ardath returns and upon examining Donald, says that his heart is all right. They telephone the other doctor and from what he says, the doctor knows that some of the cardiac depressant must have been used. Donald, when he finds this out, rushes to accuse his mother. She goes to get the drug, but takes it herself instead. As Margaret comes to the head of the stairs she overhears Donald reading a telegram from Europe saying that her husband is dead. With that she falls over and, with a bump Margaret wakes from her terrible dream. She is delighted to find that her husband is really alive and as the picture closes she says that at last she is convinced that one's duty to one's country is the highest, and says that she will never oppose Robert's responding to his country's call.",

Picking it up, he finds the paper blank. Lester's window faces Helen's window. That night, the girl informs him in pantomime that the note contains a message written in milk. Scorching brings the message into view. As the result, Lester learns that Helen is the victim of a foul plot on the part of her uncle who desires to obtain her fortune. The girl drops a notebook which contains the details. The author is thus informed that Vanderhoff, by keeping his niece drugged with a loco weed preparation, succeeds in fooling the physicians who examine her. Lester breaks into the Vanderhoff house the following morning. He is discovered by Jose, who knocks the author unconscious and places him in the room above the dining room. Vanderhoff hastens his preparations to place Helen in the insane asylum. Dr. Luchow calls for the purpose of preparing the papers. Lester, using the top of a ventilator, saws away at his bonds. The blood from his bruised hands drips down upon Luchow's paper and the doctor soon becomes aware of what is going on. Jose attacks Lester just as the latter gains his freedom, but Dr. Luchow's timely arrival saves his friend. The Mexican and Vanderhoff endeavor to make their get-away in an auto, but an explosion, which wrecks the machine, ends their villainous careers.",

But for the first time in his life, John is realizing that not everything is as set in stone as he previously believed. Facing the potential loss of his land and his livelihood, John realizes that he's going to have to make a deal that may as well be akin to selling his soul to the devil. He's going to let Hollywood come make a movie on his land. Far removed from the mountains of Montana, Fabian is a rising star in the entertainment industry. A director always balanced on the edge of the latest trends, he's known as a creative visionary and he has the big personality to go with it. He is convinced that his next picture is going to be his breakthrough and nothing is going to deter him from that vision. Not even an old crusty rancher. When John and Fabian meet, it's less business meeting and more rodeo showdown between a rider and a bull. As each of them tries to figure out how to get what they want without compromising their own values, they have no idea that their worlds are both about to fall apart. The only question now is where the pieces are going to fall and who is going to put them back together.",

A stepfather who \"thought the gun wasn't loaded\" has left him with a glass eye. But then Balli meets three boys of his own age - Addi, Konni and Siggi - and a friendship gently develops. For the first time in his life, Balli finds that he is able to connect, especially with Addi, whose mother believes in \"the subconscious\". Addi is fighting his own demons and, when his visions appear to indicate that Balli's brutal stepfather can no longer be tolerated, the boys decide to act. Icelandic director Guðmundur Arnar Guðmundsson finds poetic images for a world marked by violence and aggression in his coming-of-age drama. In it, he depicts a group of youths who are in danger of foundering on the gender-normative behavioural code of their peer group. Desperately they cling to each other - with a grip that is painful and tender in equal measure.",

In the main story John Stoddard, a construction chief building a gigantic bridge for capitalist Courtlandt Van Nest, sympathizes with the workers' dissatisfaction with low salaries and subsistence conditions. When his attempts to negotiate with Van Nest fail, the workers, led by agitator Lavinsky, prepare to strike. Van Nest's daughter Janet, who is engaged to a militia captain, visits the site and is appalled by the squalor. Despite their differences, Janet and Stoddard fall in love. When the strike breaks, Van Nest sends in the militia. As they prepare to fire, Stoddard sees Lavinsky about to throw dynamite, and wrestles it away. He then agrees to Van Nest's demand for settling the strike that he refrain from seeing Janet. After Janet leaves home to help poor families, Van Nest looks for her at Stoddard's house where Stoddard demonstrates that because of their similar ancestry, he and Van Nest are not very different. When Stoddard's sister Edith allows Van Nest to witness the surprise reunion of a worker and his wife from Europe, to whom Janet had sent transportation money, Van Nest softens and agrees to Janet's marriage to Stoddard. An epilogue follows showing blindfolded Justice saying to fat Capital and burly Labor, \"Why quarrel? You are worthless without the other.\"",

    "description": "Coronado: The New Evidence explores one of the longest-standing archaeological mysteries in the United States-the land route taken by famed explorer Francisco Vazquez de Coronado who from 1539-1542 was attempting to find vast wealth and fame while traveling north from Mexico. Through the intrepid and tireless work of Arizona-based Dr. Deni Seymour, we now know where Coronado's expedition first crossed into what would later become the continental United States. The filmmakers have exclusive access to the Coronado archeological site where our cameras have been rolling for two years as Dr. Seymour unearthed hundreds of Coronado artifacts including a breathtaking 15th-century \"wall gun\" that is the first firearm to enter what is now the United States. This discovery has dire, catastrophic far-reaching implications-not only for US history-but for the indigenous people, the Sobaipuri, and their descendants, the Wa:k O'odham, who first encountered Coronado. The Wa:k O'odham soberly and thoughtfully share their reaction and meaning of this breakthrough discovery by Seymour. Coronado was not exempt from the well-known litany of crimes committed by white Europeans against American Indigenous peoples. Dr. Seymour also discovered evidence of a Sobapuri revolt pre-dating the American Revolution, making it the first real American Revolution in what is now the U.S. This single battle kept white explorers out of the region for another 150+ years. Perhaps the biggest discovery by Seymour is that this Coronado site is the first established Spanish colony in the Southwest United States. This villa/town pre-dates San Agustín and Roanoke. Deni J. Seymour, Ph.D., has research affiliations with the University of Colorado Boulder and the University of Arizona and at Jornada Research Institute. She is the author of Where the Earth and Sky Are Sewn Together: Sobaipuri- O'odham Contexts of Contact and Colonialism (The University of Utah Press, 2011), as well as other books.",

A little later Mrs. Kelland discovers the baby putting another piece of jewelry in the basket and she decides that Joe's mother is innocent. Two crooks from the gang determine to put a stop to Kelland's activities and to \"plant\" a golf ball filled with nitroglycerin so that Kelland will be blown up as by an unknown accident.

Just as Kelland is about to strike the ball, Mrs. Kelland and Trina come into the grounds, and to save them Joe takes the blow upon his own body.

When the Count, who persuaded the townspeople to invest their savings in the venture, commits suicide, the baron jilts the now-destitute Ann. She marries Slater, an American promoter, and they move to the United States, hoping to earn enough to pay off her father's debts, but the baron follows Ann and forces his attentions on her. This provides Slater's mother, who is insanely jealous of her son's love for his wife, with the opportunity to break up their marriage. Slater orders his wife from the house and the baron offers her sanctuary. Ann's baby's incessant crying for her mother forces Slater to attempt a reconciliation, and when he looks for her, he finds her with the baron. In the ensuing fight, both men are mortally wounded. Ann returns to her child; she finds her mother-in-law repentant, and the three return to France to repay the debt.",

Into the soulful, stirring music he pours his pent up feelings of hatred, sorrow, love, and regret. Years before, Jim Maxwell's best friend Dan McGrew had deceived his wife into believing him unfaithful. Their elopement completely unnerved him for a time. But finally he resolved to forget about it, until he next met Dan McGrew. Years afterwards, while prospecting, he met his daughter, now grown to womanhood and married. Her husband had been arrested for a murder committed by McGrew, and Maxwell assisted in effecting his escape. Just previous to the miner's entrance, Nell's husband had been captured in the saloon by the sheriff. As Maxwell finishes playing, he turns about, faces Dangerous Dan McGrew, and tells him, in uncomplimentary language, what he thinks of a man of his type. The lights go out, two guns blaze in the dark, and both men fall. Maxwell recovers and is reunited with his wife Lou. McGrew dies.--May 22 1915.",

He is talking with his sweetheart Jane Dinsmore as Jane's dear friend Alice Robinson enters with a letter from an erstwhile associate, advising her to go to New York and accept a place in the chorus. A word from Temple, and Alice has made up her mind: She leaves for New York. Temple and Jane have been married some time and are living unhappily, apart from the old folks. Temple's reputation as a serious actor is wide, but drink has degraded him, and Jane dies after years of abuse from him. Shortly before her death she had sent her father a telegram describing the wretched conditions under which she was living, and the information prompts Dinsmore to go to her. when he arrives at the Temples' address, the landlady reports his daughter's persecution and death, and he swears to avenge his daughter. Alice is contented with her place as a member of a cheap stock company. The dissipated Temple has come to New York and is engaged as the lead man of Alice's company. Alice is surprised to see him but he mourns the loss of his \"poor wife\" and explains that he has changed his name to Delaney for professional reasons, and Alice accepts his explanation. Attracted by her beauty and recognizing in her much latent talent, Temple promises to make her a great actress and she fails under his hypnotic influence. James Montrose, a producer, and Frank Wentworth, his lawyer, see the play in which Temple, now known as Delaney, is starring and choose him for their new Broadway vehicle \"The Lesson.\" Delaney is engaged, and through his influence, Alice is retained to play the ingenue lead. He goes through a sham form of marriage with Alice, hiring a man named Ford to act as a parson Night after night, Delaney coaches Alice until she plays the part almost perfectly. Her big scene is in the last act, when she fires at Delaney as the curtain falls. All this time Dinsmore has been scouring the West for a trace of Temple, not knowing that he has changed his name. The play is a signal success. The first night brands Alice as a star. By chance Dinsmore, who has come to New York, sees a photograph of Delaney with Alice, and after investigation, learns that he is starring in \"The Lesson.\" He thereupon writes a number of notes to the star threatening him. The receipt of these letters has begun to undermine Delaney's nervous system. Then Alice comes upon Ford demanding from Delaney the rest of the money for performing the mock wedding. Discovering that she is not actually married to him, she expresses the wish that real bullets be in the stage revolver at the performance at the theater that evening. After several notes have been sent, Dinsmore conceives a plan to avenge his daughter's death and forges a pass which admits him backstage in the theater where Delaney is playing. He replaces the blank cartridges in the revolver with real bullets, and Alice shoots Delaney to death. She is arrested and held on the strength of a statement from the maid, who heard her express the wish about real bullets in the revolver. Dinsmore, reading of Alice's arrest in the paper, telephones Wentworth, now handling Alice's case, and without disclosing his identity, he confesses he was responsible and Alice is released. Dinsmore, realizing that there is now nothing more to live for, commits suicide. Wentworth, having long since shown affection for Alice, is now accepted by her.",

Angered, Jeffrey does not explain that it is his money that maintains their home--not her father's, as she believes. Jeffrey leaves his wife and son. On board a westbound train, Jeffrey meets Nan. She explains that she has been compromised, and that she is going away to hide. Touched by her apparent sorrow, Jeffrey tells her that, though he doesn't love her, he will try to protect her. In love with him, Nan is willing to accept him on any terms. A year later a son is born to Nan and Jeffrey. She pleads with him to divorce Madge and marry her for the sake of their son William's name, but he will not hear of it. Ben Richardson, Jeffrey's client, is a frequent visitor at their home. Richardson's sincerity eventually wins Nan; goaded by Jeffrey's indifference, she leaves him and their son to become Richardson's wife. Twenty years later David Black has developed into a splendid specimen of manhood, while his half-brother William has become the leader of a lawless band. David goes West to take charge of a mining plant. Happily married, Ben Richardson and Nan have become owners of Chanceland, a gambling-house in Colorado. \"Rodeo,\" as William Arnold is known, goes to Chanceland to try his luck, but he loses all his money. He sees Nan in the music room adjoining, and eager to make an impression on her, he saunters in. When Nan asks his name, he says they call him \"Rodeo the bandit.\" His real name, William Arnold, son of Jeffrey Arnold, from whom he had run away at 14. Never knew his mother; he guesses he'd better be going or he'd get sentimental. Not revealing her identity, Nan presses a ring into his hand, and tells him to come to her if he should be in trouble. Believing that he has surely \"caught\" the Queen, he strolls out. In the same town, his half-brother, David Black, is working on his mining schemes. In the doorway of Chanceland, \"Rodeo\" passes David Black, and both are struck by their remarkable resemblance to each other. David receives a telegram from his fiancée Kathleen May, asking him to meet her at the train which is to arrive the next morning. That night Rodeo and his men hold up the train. While Rodeo is relieving the passengers of their valuables, the conductor leaps on him, and the bandanna which concealed the bandit's features, is torn away, revealing him to Kathleen, who believes that he is David. The bandit effects a getaway. When David comes for Kathleen the next day, she snubs him and walks past him. Ben Richardson's servant sees Rodeo and his men dividing the plunder and reports to Richardson. The latter intimates to Nan that the young fellow she was interested in is suspected of a number of crimes. She realizes that her son is in danger. Disconsolate, David tries to find solace in Chanceland, where he is arrested on the charge of robbing the mails and holding up the train. Deciding on a bold stroke, Rodeo goes to see Nan. She discloses herself as his mother and pleads with him to be careful, for as soon as the prisoner proves an alibi, the sheriff will be after Rodeo. Hearing Richardson, she pushes her son into her bedroom. Richardson, suspecting that Nan is hiding her lover, dashes into the room and fires at Rodeo, who is taken to court where David is being tried for the bandit's crimes. Nan confesses to Richardson that Rodeo is her son, and hastens to court. Also in the courtroom are Kathleen and Madge, David's mother. The presiding judge is Jeffrey Arnold Black, father of the prisoner. When Rodeo is brought in, a dramatic scene ensues, during which the two half-brothers face each other. Nan embraces her wayward son, while he bewails the fact that he had found his mother only to lose her, and draws his last breath after vindicating David. A tender reconciliation follows among Madge, Jeffrey, and their son David. Richardson seeks and obtains Nan's forgiveness for his suspicions of her. David and Kathleen embrace, then discuss their hopes of a little cottage for two.",

    "description": "Lilian, little daughter of Countess Barri, and Ralph, son of the estate manager, are playing in the groves when Michael, a wandering gypsy, comes upon them. The antics of his monkey amuse the children. They beg the Countess to accompany them to the gypsy camp to see Michael's other pets. The Countess, angered when the gypsy's wife abuses her sick child, orders the wayfarers from her grounds. At dawn Lilian, thinking of the fascinating monkey, climbs from her crib and runs to the camp. The gypsies abduct her, purposing to have her take the place of their own chick who has died in the night. In the morning sturdy little Ralph bravely comforts the bereaved mother and volunteers to find the missing child. He overtakes the gypsies. Ineffectually the children attempt to get back home. They are overtaken and brought back to a cruel beating. Years pass. The gypsies have been far abroad and Ralph has been unable to restore Lilian to her mother. Now that they are near their own hearthstone, Ralph quarrels with Michael and goes away after learning that Lilian, who has become a \"star\" performer, has been engaged to do a beautiful \"Firefly\" act with a circus. Lilian is a big success. Her beauty attracts an old Baron, with whom, coincidentally, Ralph has obtained a place as chauffeur. Michael \"sells\" Lilian to the Baron. The latter takes her out in his automobile. The Baron attempts to kiss Lilian. Ralph pretends that something has gone wrong with the automobile. When the Baron alights to investigate Ralph starts the machine, leaving the Baron in the lurch. Michael, knowing that Ralph will take Lilian to the home from which she had been stolen, proceeds after them with murder in his heart. He comes upon the overjoyed mother and daughter accompanied by Ralph at the top of an old tower in which the children played years before. Michael locks them in and lights the fuse of an infernal machine, which he places in a lower window of the tower. Ralph sees the dastardly deed and strives to open the locked door. Only one way is left. Climbing out upon old telegraph wires which pass over a pond, he makes the perilous passage and drops, unhurt, into the water. The terrified watchers see him reach the infernal machine just a moment before its fuse ignites with the dynamite. Ralph throws it from him blindly. It falls into the bushes, wherein Michael has hidden himself. Michael is killed by his own petard.",

Years pass and Buck's daughter Luzelle finds herself wooed by two young men, Philip Burwood and Boyd Savely, whose families have been enemies for years. Luzelle's rejected suitor, Boyd, robs the Hineman bank, opens the strongbox containing Mrs. Hineman's papers and tampers with a letter written to her years before congratulating her on the birth of her daughter. The letter, sent to General Buck Hineman on the occasion of his daughter's marriage to Philip, gives the impression by the obliteration of a word that Remington is Luzelle's father. The wedding is halted and a duel between the two old men arranged. Each shoots in the air and realizes that neither wants to kill the other.

When the United States declares war on Germany, Robert expresses his earnest desire to enlist in the American army, much to the delight of his patriotic sister Emily. Before he can do so, however, Strumpf tells Robert the secret of his parentage, believing that the young man now will be eager to fight for Germany's cause. Robert feigns enthusiasm but secretly offers his services to the U.S. government, and with the passport provided him by the Pan-German league, he goes to Germany and kills the crown prince.

Her father was a drunkard and during one of his periods of intoxication he killed his wife and then, in trying to escape, was himself killed. Left destitute, Bessie is invited by a couple of youngsters to keep house for them. The two boys earn enough money selling papers to keep up the little establishment and Bessie does the housework. One day as she is playing in the street she is run over by an auto belonging to society lady Mrs. Latham, who feels sorry for her and visits her at the hospital where she is taken. On leaving the hospital Bessie goes to see the wealthy widow, who procures her a position at a modiste's shop. A couple of months later Bessie goes to a cheap dance hall with a friend, where she is noticed by theatrical agent Abrams, who offers her a job as a cabaret dancer and she accepts. While dancing in the cabaret she is noticed by wealthy clubman Shirley Martin, who says that he will make her a great dancer. He introduces her to a manager and all arrangements are made for the Broadway production. Shirley expects a price for his favors, but to his chagrin, he discovers that Bessie is incorruptible. Bessie's debut as a dancer is a success. Mrs. Latham, who has designs on Shirley's money, is jealous of the attentions he is paying the little dancer. She plans to so compromise her that his love will be cured. Accordingly, she invites the two of them on a weekend trip to the country and then, at the last minute, does not go herself. When the two young people arrive at the hotel, they find rooms engaged for Mr. and Mrs. Shirley Martin. When Bessie confesses that she loves him, he tries to force his attentions on her, but she repulses him. Then Shirley realizes that he has acted like a cad and when he asks her to marry him the next day, she agrees. Meanwhile, Mrs. Latham has written a note to Old Man Martin saying that Bessie is trying to ruin his son's life and that if he does not want a scandal, he must go at once to the hotel where they are registered as husband and wife. Martin hurries down and finds them there the next day. He accuses Bessie of having designs on Shirley and forbids the marriage. So Bessie, thinking that perhaps after all, the marriage would not be for the best, agrees to go away. When Shirley finds out what his father has done, he is furious, and says that he will not come home until his father consents to the marriage. But he cannot find Bessie, as she has left without giving anyone her address except old Martin. But at the Martin home, the mother has become ill, and the doctor thinks that the only thing that will save her life is a reunion with her boy. So Mr. Martin hunts up Shirley at the club and persuades him to come home for the sake of his mother, and then he goes to find Bessie. Of course the two are reunited and agree to have the long-delayed wedding take place at once.",

Harvey stoutly denies having contracted the bills, including one for $25,000, and Lemuel, though puzzled, believes him until the workers threaten to strike and the bank places an attachment on the mill. Lemuel is about to disown his son when Harold Morrowton, Harvey's college roommate, confesses that he forged Harvey's name to the bills because his own father refused to give him spending money, and Harvey adds that because the two were fraternity brothers, he could not betray Harold's trust. Exasperated, Lemuel orders both young men to pay their debts through hard labor in the mill.",

    "description": "When Count Peter Turgeneff, his daughter Nadia, and his generous-hearted son Paul came to live in the Governor's palace in the Russian province of Valogda, there was rejoicing among the oppressed race whose home was in the Ghetto. Turgeneff was known as a just and merciful man who had done much to make the hard lot of the Jews bearable in the districts under his charge. Hence his coming was hailed with joy by Isaac, prophet of Israel, and his people. Quite other feelings did his arrival create in the breast of Michael Orzoff, the grim Prefect of Police of Valogda, who sat in his office in the fortress and received the reports of the secret agents of the Czar. It was known that Orzoff was the secret power behind the dreaded \"Yellow Jackets,\" the dire organization whose avowed object was the extermination of the people of Israel. There seemed no help. The Prefect's influence reached far, even into the high places in far-off Petrograd. Even women, provided they were fair to look upon, found their sex no protection from his infamy. For all these reasons the coming of Count Turgeneff to Valogda was not at all to Orzoff's liking. Soon after his coming Orzoff learned two things: one was that the new governor had pledged his help to the Jews, and the other that his daughter Nadia was one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen and quite as ardent as her father in her support of the oppressed race. To think was to act with Orzoff. The governor was strong, but not more strong than he. In the high places in Petrograd, whence both received authority, the Prefect held the more power. In Russia the police are all powerful. The Count menaced Orzoff, for already word had been brought to the Governor, as Orzoff well knew, that the Prefect was the secret driving force behind the evil \"Yellow Jackets.\" So Orzoff laid his plan. With his countless agents provocateurs and secret minions in the \"Yellow Jackets,\" daring as that plan was, he felt it could not fail. On the night of the grand ball at the Governor's palace, the plan was consummated. Thither had come, at Nadia's urging. Isaac, chief of the Jews of the Ghetto, and Leah, the lovely daughter of old Samuels the cobbler, whose honor had been stained by the rude lust of Orzoff, with many others, there to accuse the Prefect face to face of the wrongs with which he had burdened them. But they did not reckon with the Prefect's plan. Suddenly there had been a cry without a rush of many feet and a frenzied mob had burst in among the guests of the Governor. \"Death to the Jews,\" was their rallying cry. Then came Orzoff's own uniformed men and dispersed the rioters, but not before an assassin's bullet had found a resting place in the heart of Count Turgeneff. Nor did Orzoff stop there. Secure in his influence at Petrograd, he directed his men to seize the weeping Nadia, her brother Paul, and Isaac the Jew, and imprison them in the fortress under a charge of treason. And there on the day following he found a way to wreak his evil will upon the girl. The Prefect came to her in the cell, where she passed the night. He bent over her menacingly as she sat on the stone seat that had formed her couch. \"You will give yourself to me,\" he said abruptly, \"or your brother shall suffer the torture by fire ere he goes to Siberia.\" The as Nadia, in contempt and loathing, struck at him in the half-darkness he added, \"Listen, and you shall hear for yourself; only your promised work can stop this pain.\"",
